Audiences are the specific individuals, referred to as users, or accounts,
such as companies and organizations, that qualify to be members of a segment.
You can create segments to group audiences according to a set of criteria that
you define.

  * **[About Audience Segments](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_segment_about.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
A segment is a real-time grouping of users or accounts, based on criteria you
define using a set of segment categories and rules. With segments, you can add
another layer of personalization to your campaigns, and gain deeper insight
into your customers. Segments can even include groups you've already defined
in your CRM, DMP, or marketing automation platform.

Marketing Cloud Personalization provides various categories and accompanying
rules for use with segments. When a user interacts with one of your channels,
the Personalization system identifies the segments they belong to based on
real-time session activity. Because segment updates happen in real time,
membership changes occur immediately.
