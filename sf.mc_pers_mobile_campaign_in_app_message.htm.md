# Create a Mobile In-App Message Campaign

You can use a Mobile In-App Message campaign to build and deploy messages
within mobile apps. Mobile In-App Message campaigns are similar to the infobar
messages you can add to your website. You build, manage, and deploy Mobile In-
App Message campaigns from within Personalization so you get the same real-
time data and personalization you rely on with your other campaigns. You don't
need an engineer's help or App Store approval to deploy new or changed
messages.

Set rules at the campaign level when you want to holistically control how a campaign displays.") and [Add Mobile Message Targeting Rules](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_mobile_campaign_message_targeting_rules.htm&language=en_US&type=5 "After you create a Mobile In-App Message or Mobile Data campaign, you can add message rules and promote content in Message Rules. Message rules control when a mobile in-app message shows for a visitor. For example, show the message when a visitor takes a specific action. Or only show the message a certain number of times per visit, during a specific time period, or all of the time. Use Promoted Content to promote a specific item or multiple items either by selecting the item or by using Einstein Recipes algorithms or Einstein Decisions AI.").

This example contains static message title and a message body text.

you can generate the number of reward credits using a dynamic field that pulls
data from Salesforce.
