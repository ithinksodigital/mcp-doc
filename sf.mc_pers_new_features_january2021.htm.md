"The concept of individual identity plays an essential role in personalizing
your customer experiences. Personalization aggregates all your customer data
in one place for analysis and personalization purposes. The aggregated
customer data helps you understand each of your customers on an individual
level so you can engage with them more effectively across your various
channels. Personalization uses specific identifiers to determine how to
process web events, API events, and channel events to identify and aggregate
users from various sources.").
