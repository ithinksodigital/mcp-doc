# Einstein Recipes

Einstein Recipes are Personalization's machine learning algorithms. With
Einstein Recipes, you can create configurable algorithmic strategies to
present each customer with customized product and content recommendations
throughout your various channels. You can use Einstein Recipes to support
specific scenarios, such as cross-sells, content promotions, and trending
products.

  * **[Create an Einstein Recipe](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_einstein_recipe_create.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Einstein Recipes consist of ingredients, exclusions, inclusions, boosters, and
variations. Combine these components to suggest content or products according
to an individual customer’s behavior and affinities. Personalization uses your
recipes to create algorithms that present each customer with their own
personalized recommendations.

  * **[Use a Static Relationship in an Einstein Recipe](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_einstein_recipe_static_relationship.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
After you associate products with each other in a static relationship, you can
use it as an ingredient in Einstein Recipes to define which products to
recommend with other products. When making recommendations, Personalization
considers any static relationships you’ve configured.

  * **[Use a SmartBundle Relationship in an Einstein Recipe](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_einstein_recipe_smartbundle_relationship.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
After you associate categories with each other in a SmartBundle relationship,
you can use the SmartBundle ingredient in Einstein Recipes to define which
items to recommend with other items. When making recommendations,
Personalization considers items from SmartBundle-related categories that
customers bought together in the same cart.

  * **[Use a Static List in an Einstein Recipe](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_einstein_recipe_static_list.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Use static lists that you create in Einstein Recipes as exclusions,
inclusions, or boosters.

  * **[Test an Einstein Recipe](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_einstein_recipe_test.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
After creating and training an Einstein recipe, make sure to test it before
you publish it. Using test groups can simulate the recommendations that
Personalization presents to a group of customers. Testing your recipe with
groups that have varying behaviors and affinities helps ensure optimal
customer experiences.

  * **[Troubleshoot an Einstein Recipe](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_einstein_recipe_troubleshoot.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Examine Einstein recipes and unified customer profiles if you run into
unexpected recommendations. Einstein Recipes can consist of multiple
components with a variety of parameters. The algorithms are complex, and some
recipe options can conflict with one another. Any initial recommendations you
receive can require some fine-tuning to meet your expectations.
