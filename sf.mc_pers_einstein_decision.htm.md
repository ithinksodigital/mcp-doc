# Einstein Decisions

When a user views a promotion on your website, Marketing Cloud Personalization
captures the user's context—including whether they’re a returning visitor, the
device they’re using, and other information that provides insight into that
user. Einstein Decisions, Personalization’s machine learning approach for
next-best-offer decisioning, uses that context to predict the value of showing
a specific offer to a particular user.

  * **[About Einstein Decisions](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_einstein_decision_about.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Einstein Decisions automates the process of deciding who sees what content, so
you don’t have to manually create complex rules. For example, you define an
area on the homepage for five different promotions—credit cards, mortgages,
auto loans, checking accounts, and retirement plans—and you're not sure which
promotion to display when. Einstein Decisions takes away the guesswork by
continuously learning from the data Personalization collects about users, and
presents the promotion with the highest likelihood of generating the most
lift.

  * **[Feature Engineering in Einstein Decisions](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_einstein_decision_feature_engineering.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Feature engineering refers to the process of selecting features to use in a
machine learning model. A feature is a data type that the model can observe
and include in its training. To determine which data Einstein Decisions
references, you define the machine learning features on the Feature
Engineering page.

  * **[Configure Einstein Decisions](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_einstein_decision_configure.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Einstein Decisions analyzes many unique data points when determining the right
experience to present to a particular user. This data includes user behaviors
as well as contextual data, such as device type, time of day, and demographic
data. Einstein Decisions can also reference segment membership and user
attribute data, along with catalog objects you create in your catalog. To
determine which data Einstein Decisions references, you define the machine
learning features on the Feature Engineering page. Typically, a data science
or analytics team member configures the feature engineering options for
Einstein Decisions.

  * **[Promotion Management for Einstein Decisions](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_einstein_decision_promote.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
After you configure Einstein Decisions, add an initial set of promotions and
assets to a dataset, and publish an Einstein Decisions campaign, you can begin
planning your ongoing promotion management.

  * **[Einstein Reports](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_einstein_report.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Einstein Decisions provides reports as an outcome of Marketing Cloud
Personalization’s continuous model training. Each time the machine learning
model trains, which typically occurs multiple times per week, Personalization
creates a report. These reports provide your analytics and data science teams
with additional insight into how and why the Einstein Decisions algorithms are
making their decisions.

  * **[Einstein Decisions Limits](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_einstein_decision_limits.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Marketing Cloud Personalization has limits for some Einstein Decisions
features.
