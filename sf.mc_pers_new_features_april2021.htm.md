# April 2021 Features in Interaction Studio

The following functionality was released in April, 2021.

## Interaction Studio Surveys

Interaction Studio Surveys make it easy for you to configure and deploy web
surveys using an intuitive in-app survey editor and corresponding [web
template](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/marketing/personalization/guide/web-
surveys.html). You can direct surveys to customers or prospects based on the
full set of campaign targeting logic available in Interaction Studio. Survey
responses are captured and stored in real-time in each respondent's unified
customer profile. Responses can be used for further experience targeting and
segmentation during the same interaction so you can immediately act on the
explicit data you capture. Survey's are available to premium edition clients.

## Hotel Gear

Interaction Studio's Hotel Gear represents one of the first industry
accelerator gears and is designed to help travel and hospitality clients
maximize booking data. The Hotel Gear comes equipped with two ETLs
([Booking](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_hotel_gear_etl.htm&language=en_US&type=5)
and [Booking Add-
On](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_hotel_gear_booking_add_on.htm&language=en_US&type=5))
and five rules designed to reference the data brought in through segmentation
and campaign targeting data feeds. The Hotel Gear is available to both Growth
and Premium Edition clients.

## Comparison Shopping

Comparison Shopping is a use case designed to identify customers who might be
"deal shopping" and looking to find one of your products on a different site.
Using the [developer
doc](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/marketing/personalization/guide/comparison-
shopping.html), you can configure your sitemap to recognize when a shopper
highlights the name of one of your products on the product display page and
then use this action to trigger a campaign experience encouraging the shopper
to buy directly from you. This action can be configured as part of any
sitemap.
