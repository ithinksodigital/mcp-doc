# Update a Booking

You can use the Booking ETL data feed to update booking information in
Personalization, such as updating a check-in time that wasn’t in the initial
booking.

### Required User Permissions

Permissions Needed

  1. To update a booking with new information, include the entire contents of the booking in the file. Include all line items for the booking, even if they aren’t changing.

If the Booking ETL file has a bookingID from a previously recorded booking,
Personalization removes any records for that booking.
