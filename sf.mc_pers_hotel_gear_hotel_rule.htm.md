Use hotel rules for web and server-side campaign targeting, or for segmenting
customers. You can group or target customers based on traveler details. For
example, hotel rules can consider travel party size, booking status, scheduled
check-in or check-out time, number of nights’ stay over a time range, or add-
ons purchased.
