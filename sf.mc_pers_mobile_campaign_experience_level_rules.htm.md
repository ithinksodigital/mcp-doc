# Mobile Experience-Level Rules

For all types of mobile campaigns, if you set experience-level rules, each
experience needs a qualifying rule. Mobile app users who qualify for the
campaign see the first experience in the list for which they qualify. If you
set a control percentage, it applies only to users who have qualified for the
experience.

## Target Users

Define who sees an experience based on one or more segments.

Select specific segments a mobile app user does or doesnâ€™t belong to. If you
include multiple segments, Personalization handles them using AND logic.

## Target Pages

For Mobile In-App and Mobile Push campaigns, you can choose which action
should trigger the experience.

Item | Description  
---|---  
With Action | Show after viewer completes a specific action. If you include multiple actions, they will be considered with OR logic.  
With Item Action | Show after article or item views, purchases, and other visitor behaviors. If you include multiple item actions, they will be considered with OR logic.
