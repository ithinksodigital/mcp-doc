# Identity System Setup for the Event API

With Personalizationâ€™s identity system, you can configure the identifiers in
the Event API to create Unified Customer Profiles for each of your customers.
To merge user profiles from various sources, you designate an identity type to
use when matching users between the Event API and Personalization. You can use
multiple identifiers in the Event API.
