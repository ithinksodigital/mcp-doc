Learn about the Unified Customer Profile.

## Real-time Aggregation of Data

Personalization captures applicable user data and updates the Unified Customer
Profile in real time. You can supplement that user data with offline data or
data you collect from other systems so you can see preferences, affinities,
interaction history, and behavior at an individual level.

## Collect Common Information Across Industries

Although the components of the Unified Customer Profile vary slightly by
industry, Personalization collects the same detailed information for each
user, including activity, timeline, geography, segments, and known
preferences.

## Cross-channel Decisioning

Personalization uses the information in each user profile to power real-time,
cross-channel decisions, such as whether a user qualifies for certain
promotions. The Unified Customer Profile also helps decide which
recommendations to present to a user, or whether to add a user to a specific
journey in Journey Builder. The Unified Customer Profile helps create an
optimal experience for every user, regardless of how they choose to interact
with your company.

## Explore Unified Customer Profiles

You can view a Unified Customer Profile by selecting **User Segments** | **All Users** from the main navigation and then double-clicking the user.
