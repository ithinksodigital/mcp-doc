# Create a Segment Based on a Specific Action Count

Create segments for your campaigns to target users who complete one or more
actions a specific number of times. To capture users who complete an action a
specific number of times, create two action rules that relate to each other.

Example

To create a segment of users who complete the action "Home" twice, create two
rules. The first rule captures all users who perform the action "Home" two or
more times. The second rule captures all users who donâ€™t perform the action
"Home" three or more times. The second rule acts as a ceiling on the number of
times a user completes the action. Because a user must meet both rules to be
in this segment, the segment contains all users who complete the action "Home"
just two times.
