# Filters and Global Goals

Establishing filters and global goals to better monitor the results of
specific campaigns and gauge the impact of campaigns against overall business
goals.

  * **[Filter Strategy and Planning](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_filter_strategy_planning.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Create filters for use with reporting and campaign statistics, or use any
default filters.

  * **[Create a Filter](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_filter_create.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Create filters for your dataset for use in reporting and campaign statistics.
When you apply a filter, only the people who meet the filter category are
included in the metrics. Global goals are the primary objectives that you want
visitors or users to complete. A visitor or user completes a global goal when
they join the corresponding segment. You can use filters in reporting and
campaign statistics.

  * **[Use Filters](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_filter_use.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Use filters to view data on a more granular level. You can apply filters to
data in certain reports or in campaign statistics.

  * **[Global Goal Strategy and Planning](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_goal_strategy_planning.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Create filters for use with reporting and campaign statistics, or use any
default filters. Create global goals (primary objectives) that you want your
visitors to complete.

  * **[Create a Goal](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_goal_create.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Global goals are the primary actions that you want visitors or users to
complete on your website, SaaS app, or mobile app. Because global goals are
created from segments, you must first create a segment defined with the
criteria that you want to use for the global goal. Any global goal can also be
used as a filter.

  * **[Use Goals](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_goal_use.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Select a global goal in campaign statistics to display the number and the rate
of goal completions for that global goal. Selecting a goal also adds a
corresponding graph of these values over time below the summary. Global goals
are recorded for all relevant activity from the time they’re created. It’s
important to plan ahead and create goals before the activity you want to
measure occurs.
