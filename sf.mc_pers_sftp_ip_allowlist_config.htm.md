# Configure an SFTP IP Allowlist

Use SFTP IP allow lists to improve system security. Using allowlists to
identify individual IP addresses or ranges of IP addresses that belong to your
network, Personalization can prevent bad actors from gaining SFTP access. If
you donâ€™t create an allowlist, or your allowlist is empty, Personalization
accepts SFTP connections from any IP address.
