Important Make sure to assign roles to Personalization users for their
datasets. Until an administrator assigns them a role for any datasets, users
won’t have access to Personalization navigation or functions. Users without
assigned roles get the message “You do not have any permissions for this
dataset. Contact your administrator or switch datasets.”

## Role Permissions

Role permissions are categorized by functional area:

  * channels
  * audiences
  * machine learning
  * settings

## Administrator Permissions

Administrator permissions are granted at the Marketing Cloud level.
