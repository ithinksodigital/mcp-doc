Before adding the next-best components, set up your environment as described
in [Personalization for Sales and Service Cloud Integration
Setup](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_salesforce_sales_service_cloud_connector_prereqs.htm&language=en_US&type=5
"Before configuring Personalization experiences, make sure to set up your
environment by completing these prerequisites in order.").

You must also have these components configured:

  * Recipes built to support your business strategy for recommendations. For more information, see [Einstein Recipes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_einstein_recipe.htm&language=en_US&type=5 "Einstein Recipes are Personalization's machine learning algorithms. With Einstein Recipes, you can create configurable algorithmic strategies to present each customer with customized product and content recommendations throughout your various channels. You can use Einstein Recipes to support specific scenarios, such as cross-sells, content promotions, and trending products.").
  * A configured Einstein Decisions feature set. For more information, see [Einstein Decisions](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_einstein_decision.htm&language=en_US&type=5 "When a user views a promotion on your website, Marketing Cloud Personalization captures the user's context—including whether they’re a returning visitor, the device they’re using, and other information that provides insight into that user. Einstein Decisions, Personalization’s machine learning approach for next-best-offer decisioning, uses that context to predict the value of showing a specific offer to a particular user.").

  1. Next to Setup, select the **Sales** or **Service** app.
  2. Open a **Contact** or **Lead** record.
  3. Click the Setup icon and select **Edit Page**.
  4. In the **Components** pane, in the Custom section, drag **Next Best Product** and **Next Best Promotion and Action** onto the page. The contact page loads with the two new components.
