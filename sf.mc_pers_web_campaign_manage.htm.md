# Manage Web Campaigns

Create and manage templates for web campaigns.

  * **[Create a Web Campaign](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_web_campaign_create.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Using a web campaign, you can personalize various aspects of your website for
your users based on their behavior, affinities, preferences, location, or
other qualifying criteria. You can create web campaigns from templates in your
dataset. The templates provide a framework that defines the campaign
placement, copy and creative locations, and general campaign design.

  * **[Clone a Web Campaign](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_web_campaign_clone.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
You can clone a web campaign so you can reuse all or part of it in another web
campaign. For example, if you have a web campaign with experiences and
templates you want to use, but want to change the rules, you can clone the
campaign. Then you adjust the rules, test the campaign, and publish it.

  * **[Create a Web Campaign from a Template](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_web_campaign_create_from_template.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
You can create a web campaign from a published web campaign template.

  * **[Create a Web Campaign from a Content Zone](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_web_campaign_create_from_content_zone.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
You can create a web campaign from a content zone.

  * **[Use Marketing Cloud Personalization Trends](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_web_campaign_interaction_studio_trend.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Personalization Trends uses social validation to increase conversions. Most
consumers are overwhelmed by the product choices available to them and can
find it challenging to confidently buy products online. Use view and purchase
counters to influence users of your website in real time and build confidence
in their product selections.

  * **[Schedule a Web Campaign](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_web_campaign_schedule.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
You can schedule your web campaigns to ensure that personalized experiences
only display between certain dates, during certain days of the week, or even
during certain hours of the day. This increased control helps you further
target and tailor personalized content to your users across various channels.

  * **[Manage Web Campaign Priorities](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_web_campaign_priority.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
When a customer qualifies for multiple web campaigns that target the same
content zone and match a particular page or action, Marketing Cloud
Personalization shows only one of those campaigns. You can adjust the priority
values for campaigns to determine which campaign displays. Campaigns with a
higher priority value have precedence. When campaigns have the same priority
value, the campaign that was created first has precedence.

  * **[Test a Campaign Experience](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_web_campaign_experience_test.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Although you can see your web campaign render as you create it, you can also
test each campaign experience to see how it will appear to your intended
audience. Testing the campaign experience allows you to view it, regardless of
the qualification rules at the experience or campaign level. With campaign
experience testing, you can review how the experience looks on the page.

  * **[Test a Web Campaign](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_web_campaign_test.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Use the campaign testing mode to test your campaigns before you publish them
to ensure they display the way you intend.

  * **[Publish a Web Campaign](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_web_campaign_publish.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
After you thoroughly test your campaign, you publish it to your website so
that itâ€™s visible to qualified users.
