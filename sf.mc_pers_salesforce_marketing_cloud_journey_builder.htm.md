# Integrate Personalization with Journey Builder

Pass data from Journey Builder to Personalization during the course of a
customer journey.

Add a Personalization Activity to a Journey Builder journey. Include custom
action names that indicate the journey or journey step. From Journey Builder,
send actions, identifiers, and attributes for identity merging, segmentation
and targeting, and personalization. Use this shared data to personalize the
experience your customers have with your website or mobile app based on recent
journey interactions.
