# Ingesting Data into Marketing Cloud Personalization

Marketing Cloud Personalization Feeds is a built-in data-feed processing
capability that enables the ingestion of data from external sources. Feeds are
a specific type of Personalization Gear extension that provides the pathways
to ingest external data files and translate their contents into the
Personalization platform. With Feeds, you can update the company catalog,
import and export market segments, load historical data, and perform other
tasks manually or automatically. After you configure a Feed, Personalization
business users can use the **Feeds Dashboard** to view, monitor, and manage
Feed data file processing.

Companies are responsible for creating, structuring, and providing data files
that meet Personalization specifications. However, Personalization Gear
developers are responsible for configuring the Feed pathways that support
these data files.
