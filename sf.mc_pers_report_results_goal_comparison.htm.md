This report can show visit status of new versus returning visitors or an
engagement of high, medium, or low. You can change the reporting time range to
be the previous or the current week, month, or quarter. When viewing the Goal
Comparison report, keep the following in mind:

  * Goal comparisons arenâ€™t tracked retroactively.
  * New goals are tracked only after you add them, and they don't include visitors who joined the goal segment before it was defined as a goal.
  * You can select filters from any that you configure, and from the preconfigured filters available on your site.
