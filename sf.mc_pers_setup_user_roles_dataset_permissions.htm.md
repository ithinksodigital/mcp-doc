# User Roles and Dataset Permissions

Personalization includes default roles that you can assign to users. Because
roles are specific to a dataset, you can assign access to users only at the
level they need. You can also create custom roles to grant particular
permissions.

Marketing Cloud users must work with an administrator to create a
Personalization user account. Before Marketing Cloud users can use
Personalization, administrators for Marketing Cloud and Personalization must
coordinate with users to set up permissions and access. After a Marketing
Cloud administrator enables Personalization for a user, the user navigates to
Personalization in Marketing Cloud, which creates their Personalization user
account. After the user creates their account, a Personalization administrator
can assign role-based permissions to the account.

  * **[Add a User Role](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_user_role_add.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Use a default role that you can modify, or create roles with permissions that
meet your security requirements and business needs. Because roles are dataset-
specific, Personalization users can have different roles in different
datasets. Although a role is dataset-specific, when you add a role, it’s
available to select in all datasets.

  * **[Edit a User Role](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_user_role_edit.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Modify a default role, or create roles with permissions that meet your
security requirements and business needs. Because roles are dataset-specific,
Personalization users can have different roles in different datasets. Changes
to roles are effective immediately. Although a role is dataset-specific, when
you modify a role, it’s available to select in all datasets.

  * **[Delete a User Role](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_user_role_delete.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Delete roles that are no longer needed. When you delete an assigned role,
permissions default to any other roles a Personalization user has. To access
Personalization, users must have an assigned role.
