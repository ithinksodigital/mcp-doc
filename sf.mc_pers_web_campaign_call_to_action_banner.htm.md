# Banner with Call-to-Action Web Campaigns

You can create a banner with call-to-action web campaign that replaces the
existing banner on your website. Use the built-in global template or use a
custom template that a developer creates.

## Banner with Call-to-Action Web Template

The banner with call-to-action web template available to you can differ in
name and configuration options due to modifications by your developer. If you
need additional styling or configuration options, ask your template developer
about modifying the template.

**Banner with Call-to-Action** —Select this template to display a banner with
a single call-to-action message.

Item | Description  
---|---  
**Content Zone** | Available content zones appear in this dropdown. If your developer selected a single content zone, there isn’t a content zone dropdown. If you need another content zone, ask your developer to modify the template.  
**Background Image URL** | This template lets you add the URL for a hosted image. Locate the image, click it to open it in a browser window, copy its URL, and enter that in the field. Ensure that the URL doesn’t change. If the URL changes or if you delete the image, the campaign doesn’t display correctly.  
**Style** | This template offers the options of **Dark on Light** (dark text on a light image) and **Light on Dark** (light text on a dark image) for flexibility according to the background image.  
**Header** | This text is the main headline for the campaign.  
**Subheader** | This text is smaller and located beneath the header.  
**CTA Text** | This text appears on the prestyled call-to-action button within the banner.  
**CTA Destination URL** | This URL is the page where users land when they click the call-to-action button.

Note If the landing page doesn't align with your targeting logic or campaign
goals, you can create a confusing experience for your users.
