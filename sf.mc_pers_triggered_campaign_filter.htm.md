# Filters for Triggered Campaigns

You can apply user behavior or catalog filters for some triggered campaigns to
refine qualification for trigger activation. A user behavior filter is based
on customer interaction with the trigger items. A catalog filter is based on
catalog attributes. For example, you can add a catalog filter to a product
back in stock trigger to have it activate only if the item price is less than
$100. Or, you can add a behavior filter so the trigger only activates if the
user favorites the product.

A user behavior filter is based on customer interaction with the trigger
items. Your developer configures these item actions in your account. You can
add multiple user behavior filters, and the user must meet all the criteria to
qualify for the trigger.

  * **[Catalog Filters](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_triggered_campaign_catalog_filter.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
A catalog filter is based on the catalog attributes and dimensions that youâ€™ve
assigned to the item type.
