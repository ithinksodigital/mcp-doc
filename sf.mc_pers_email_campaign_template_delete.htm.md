Before you can delete an open time item template, you must delete any
campaigns that use the template. If you try to delete an open time item
template with associated campaigns, you receive an error message that lists
those campaigns.

Before you delete a published Open Time Email campaign, consider whether any
emails were sent for that campaign. Deleting a published email campaign breaks
image links. If a recipient opens an email from a deleted Open Time Email
campaign, they see broken image links.

  1. In the **Channels & Campaigns** section of the main navigation, select **Email > Open Time Item Templates**.
  2. Select the open time item template you want to delete and click **Delete**.
  3. Confirm that you want to delete the template.
