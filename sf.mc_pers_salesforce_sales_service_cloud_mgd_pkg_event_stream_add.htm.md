the event. To view inventory status, make sure to specify the inventory count
in the sitemap. Inventory count is stored in the product catalog. For more
information about sitemaps, including catalog information examples, see the
developer documentation [Getting Started with Site
Mapping](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/marketing/personalization/guide/sitemapping-
getting-started.html?q=sitemap).
