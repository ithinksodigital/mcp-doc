# Identity System Setup for Mobile Apps

Use the Personalization identity system to identify and merge user profiles in
your mobile app.

  * **[Identity System for Mobile Apps](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_identity_mobile_apps_about.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
The Personalization identity system enables you to select a default identity
attribute to match users between your mobile application and Personalization.
Personalization uses only one identity attribute in looking up and merging
mobile app events.

  * **[Configure the Identity System for Mobile Apps](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_identity_mobile_apps_configure.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Select the identity attribute that Personalization uses for identity lookup
and merging user profiles in mobile apps. If you have active mobile app
campaigns, changing this setting can impact the content that appears for those
campaigns.
