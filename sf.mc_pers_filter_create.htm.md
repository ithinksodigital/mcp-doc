# Create a Filter

Create filters for your dataset for use in reporting and campaign statistics.
When you apply a filter, only the people who meet the filter category are
included in the metrics. Global goals are the primary objectives that you want
visitors or users to complete. A visitor or user completes a global goal when
they join the corresponding segment. You can use filters in reporting and
campaign statistics.
