# Reports and Analytics

After personalizing your site, use Personalization reports to determine what’s
working and where to make improvements.

  * **[Report Categories](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_report_categories.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Marketing Cloud Personalization provides reports that cover a number of
categories. These reports provide metrics about user-focused activities,
results and goal completions, customer visits and engagement, and metrics to
help manage your Marketing Cloud Personalization product consumption.

  * **[How to Access Reports](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_report_access.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Access Personalization reports to view sophisticated yet easy-to-understand
analytics, statistics, and attribution metrics. By default, Personalization
shows the Reports Dashboard as the first page.

  * **[Change a Report Lookback Period](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_report_change_lookback.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
The default lookback period is the past week to the current day. You can
change the lookback period for most reports. The new lookback period persists
for the session or until you make other changes.

  * **[Reports Dashboard](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_report_dashboard.htm&language=en_US&type=5#mc_pers_report_dashboard)**  
Gain insights about visitor and campaign activity on your site using the
Reports Dashboard. Depending on your industry or function, the Reports
Dashboard provides different sections. If you track transactions in the
Personalization system, the dashboard shows Total Stats first. If you don’t
track transactions in the Personalization system, Activity appears first. If
your site tracks content views or product purchases, the dashboard shows the
Items section at the bottom.

  * **[Activity Reports](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_report_activity.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Activity Reports show a variety of metrics that are tracked on your site. You
see a real-time list of recent visitors, the path that they took, and their
actions while visiting.

  * **[Results Reports](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_report_results.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Understanding the metrics for revenue, the purchase funnel, and goal
completions helps you optimize your personalization initiatives. Results
reports include the Revenue Report, the Purchase Funnel Report, the Goal
Comparison Report, and the Goal Completions Report.

  * **[Visits Reports](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_report_visits.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
The Visits section of Personalization reports shows metrics on visitor
behavior, visitor technologies, and referring sources. Each of the three
reports in the Visits section offer multiple views.

  * **[Usage Reports](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_report_usage.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Monitor org total and dataset-specific Personalization product metrics,
proactively manage Personalization usage, and view historical Personalization
product consumption data.

  * **[Guardian](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_guardian.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Make the most out of your Personalization campaigns using Guardian.

  * **[Personalization Data Warehouse](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_data_warehouse.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Marketing Cloud Personalization tracks and measures engagement—at the
individual and account levels—across your company’s channels. The Data
Warehouse is a repository of personalization data that is optimized for
analysis. Business analysts can use their preferred business intelligence (BI)
tool to access the Data Warehouse and run queries to transform, report on,
