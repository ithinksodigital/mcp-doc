# Channels and Campaigns

In Personalization, channels are the various digital touch points you use to
interact and engage with your customers and leads. Campaigns are the heart of
providing personalized experiences within each of those channels. Depending on
your Marketing Cloud Personalization license, you have access to develop
campaigns for channels such as web, email, mobile, and third-party
integrations.

Campaigns are at the heart of personalizing your web channel to provide
experiences that resonate with your users. Using a web campaign, you can
personalize various aspects of your website for your users based on their
behavior, affinities, preferences, location, or other qualifying criteria.

  * **[Server-Side Campaigns](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_server_side_campaign.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Server-side campaigns integrate testing and personalization at the server-to-
server level. While Marketing Cloud Personalization handles the campaign
logic, you need a developer to write the code to call the appropriate APIs and
provide information about the website visitor.

  * **[Triggered Campaigns](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_triggered_campaign.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
A trigger is a specific event, such as a visitor behavior or environmental
change that prompts a Marketing Cloud Personalization action, such as sending
an email. You can create a triggered campaign to target different user
segments, provide different experiences for different users, include A/B
testing, or define a campaign schedule or frequency.

  * **[Open Time Email Campaigns](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_email_campaign.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Use open time email campaigns to deliver personalized content and product
recommendations each time a recipient opens an email. Using existing email
campaigns that you send using your mail marketing service, Open Time Email
campaigns deliver real-time personalized content to each member of your
subscriber list.

  * **[Mobile Campaigns](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_mobile_campaign.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
With Personalization mobile campaigns, you can build and deploy personalized
experiences for your Android and iOS mobile apps using native app code,
including Java, Objective-C, and Swift. Before you can create a mobile
campaign, you must complete the Personalization Mobile SDK implementation.
