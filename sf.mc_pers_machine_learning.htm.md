Marketing Cloud Personalization uses advanced machine learning algorithms to
capture a deep understanding of your business and your users. Einstein Recipes
and Einstein Decisions use those algorithms to present personalized
recommendations and offer the most relevant experiences to your users in real
time.

Einstein Recipes are Personalization's machine learning algorithms. With
Einstein Recipes, you can create configurable algorithmic strategies to
present each customer with customized product and content recommendations
throughout your various channels. You can use Einstein Recipes to support
specific scenarios, such as cross-sells, content promotions, and trending
products.

When a user views a promotion on your website, Marketing Cloud Personalization
captures the user's context—including whether they’re a returning visitor, the
device they’re using, and other information that provides insight into that
user. Einstein Decisions, Personalization’s machine learning approach for
next-best-offer decisioning, uses that context to predict the value of showing
a specific offer to a particular user.
