# Clone a Web Campaign

You can clone a web campaign so you can reuse all or part of it in another web
campaign. For example, if you have a web campaign with experiences and
templates you want to use, but want to change the rules, you can clone the
campaign. Then you adjust the rules, test the campaign, and publish it.
