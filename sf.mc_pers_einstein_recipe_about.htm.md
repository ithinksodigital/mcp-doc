  * **[Einstein Recipe Ingredients](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_einstein_recipe_ingredient.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Ingredients form the core algorithm in Einstein Recipes. When Personalization
creates recommendations for your customers, ingredients define the parameters
for considering items in your catalog. Personalization then weights those
items according to your customers’ behaviors and affinities. Exclusions,
inclusions, boosters, and variations help refine the recommendations.

  * **[Exclusions and Inclusions in Einstein Recipes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_einstein_recipe_exclusion_inclusion.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Use exclusions and inclusions to add filtering criteria to your Einstein
Recipes to control which items to recommend to your customers. For example,
you can add an exclusion to show only items from the same category as the item
a customer is viewing. A customer who views a specific hat brand only sees
recommendations for other hats, and not items from the same brand.

  * **[Fallback Strategies](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_einstein_recipe_fallback_strategies.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Fallback techniques can enhance your Einstein recipe-building strategy and
ensure that a recipe returns enough items to fill the recommendation slots
designated by a campaign.

  * **[Boosters in Einstein Recipes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_einstein_recipe_booster.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Include boosters in Einstein recipes to boost items matching a customer’s
affinity in any recommendations Personalization presents.

  * **[Variations in Einstein Recipes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_einstein_recipe_variation.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Use variations in Einstein Recipes to modify the recommendations that
Personalization presents so that your customers see a wider array of items.
For example, you can configure a variation to force a recipe to show at most
two items from the same category. So if a customer has an affinity for the
"hats" category, Personalization recommends the two most relevant hats and a
variety of other items from different categories.
