# Set the Unified Customer Profile Type

The Unified Customer Profile provides an overview of all information that
Personalization collects about a particular user—or account if your
organization also markets to businesses. If you market to businesses, the
Unified Account Profile displays aggregate information for the account. The
information that displays depends on the type of business you
select—ecommerce, demand generation, or SaaS.
