# View Triggered Campaign Statistics

Get insights on campaign performance and the impact on revenue and
conversions. You can also see a breakdown of each phase of the triggering
process to troubleshoot a failed trigger.

To view campaign statistics for a campaign, the campaign must have recorded
campaign impressions.

  1. From the main navigation, in the Channels & Campaigns section, select **Triggered** | **Triggered Campaigns**.
  2. Locate the campaign, and click **Statistics**.

Change the time period as needed.

  3. To view the number of triggers that met the profile data requirements for the campaign, go to **Total** | **Triggers**.

The Eligible Triggers section shows the number of successful, disqualified,
and failed triggers during the time period that you selected.

Triggers can fail if there are mismatch issues with mandatory Marketing Cloud
Engagement data extension fields and the data that Personalization sends.
These issues can apply to data types or empty values.

  4. In the **Eligible Triggers Workflow** section, view a breakdown of each phase of the triggering process to debug any failed triggers. To display a list of qualification stages, click a section of the chart.
