# Set Up Marketing Cloud Personalization

Set up your Marketing Cloud Personalization org by configuring account and
access settings.

  * **[Personalization Account Settings](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_personalization_account_settings.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
During your Marketing Cloud Personalization implementation, your development
and marketing teams work with your Salesforce account manager to configure the
Personalization account settings for your organization. Within those settings,
you define and configure your data model and integration setup. You can then
access and adjust key configurations.

  * **[Access Management](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_user.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Administrators control user and Salesforce employee access to Personalization.
Access to Personalization starts within Marketing Cloud, but administrators
manage user roles and permissions in Personalization. Administrators also
manage user data changes, SFTP users and files, and two-factor authentication.
