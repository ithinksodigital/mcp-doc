Learn about managing access and user data.

## Personalization Permissions

Before Marketing Cloud users can log in to Personalization, you must grant
access to Personalization from Marketing Cloud. You also must create
Personalization user roles with permissions. After a user logs in to
Personalization from Marketing Cloud, Personalization automatically creates
the user account. Then, you can assign each user at least one role in
Personalization so they can access one or more Personalization datasets in
their account.

## User Data Changes

Consumers have the right to limit, modify, and request removal of the data
companies collect about them. You can fulfill consumer data requests in
Personalization or with the Personalization REST API, which uses API tokens to
authorize all data changes.

## SFTP Users and Files

You can send and receive data automatically using a secure FTP site. An
administrator can create and manage SFTP credentials and view SFTP files in
Personalization.

## Two-Factor Authentication

If your company isnâ€™t using SAML, you can enable two-factor authentication
(2FA) to add another layer of security to Personalization.
