by the actions tracked in the dataset.

Actions are events that are assigned a name in Personalization. Actions such
as page loads, clicks, or tracked events are captured during implementation.

When using the Actions report, keep the following in mind:

  * Select **Page Views only** to see only page type actions.
  * You can filter by modules, keyword, or segments.
  * To narrow the results to visitors from a particular segment, apply segment filters.

To plot the data point for an action on the graph, select the action from the
list view. You can see a comparison of different actions. The colored dot
corresponds to the colored line on the graph.
