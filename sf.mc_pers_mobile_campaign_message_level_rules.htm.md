Message-level rules control visibility at the message level based on mobile
app user actions and display frequency. For Mobile In-App Message and Mobile
Push campaigns, you can use the message level to define who sees your message
and when.

## Target Pages

For Mobile In-App Message and Mobile Push campaigns, you can choose which
action triggers the message.

Option | Description  
---|---  
**With Action** | Triggers a message after a mobile app user views a specific page. Pages are listed by defined page name. If you include multiple actions, Personalization handles them using OR logic.  
**With Item Action** | Triggers a message after a mobile app user views an article or item, makes a purchase, or completes other user behaviors. If you include multiple item actions, Personalization handles them using OR logic.  
  
## Display Frequency

To adjust how often a mobile app user sees a message, add a Display Frequency
message rule. Display frequency can be based on:

Option | Description  
---|---  
**Current Visit** | Sets the maximum number of times a user sees the message per visit.  
**Interval** | Sets the maximum number of times a user sees the message over a period of minutes, hours, or days.  
**All-time** | Sets the maximum number of times a user sees the message for all time, regardless of the number of visits.
