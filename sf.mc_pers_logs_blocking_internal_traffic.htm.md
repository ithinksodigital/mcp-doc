# Block Internal Traffic from Logs

You can block internal traffic and behavior from Marketing Cloud
Personalization’s logs. For example, you can block internal users who log in
to your customer's portals, such Customer Success employees logging in for
training. Blocking is by user ID, which can differ from username and email
address.

### Required User Permissions

the blocklist. Data recorded before the block can’t be removed.
