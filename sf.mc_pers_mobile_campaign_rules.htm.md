# Use Mobile Campaign Rules

A critical part of a good personalization strategy is giving mobile app users
information related to what theyâ€™re doing or feeling in the moment. Use
campaign, experience, and message rules to deliver your message to the right
person at the best time for them.

For all types of mobile campaigns, campaign-wide rules control visibility at
the campaign level based on things such as segments, visit count, visit
duration, user actions, and date and time. Set rules at the campaign level
when you want to holistically control how a campaign displays for qualified
mobile app users.

  * **[Add Mobile Campaign Targeting Rules](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_mobile_campaign_targeting_rules.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Campaign-wide rules control the visibility of mobile campaigns based on things
like segments, visit count and duration, and user actions. Set rules at the
campaign level when you want to holistically control how a campaign displays.

  * **[Mobile Experience-Level Rules](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_mobile_campaign_experience_level_rules.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
For all types of mobile campaigns, if you set experience-level rules, each
experience needs a qualifying rule. Mobile app users who qualify for the
campaign see the first experience in the list for which they qualify. If you
set a control percentage, it applies only to users who have qualified for the
experience.

  * **[Add Mobile Experience Targeting Rules](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_mobile_campaign_experience_targeting_rules.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Experience-level rules are available only for rule-based campaigns. They
control qualification criteria of campaign experiences based on segments and
the actions of mobile app users.

  * **[Mobile Message-Level Rules](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_mobile_campaign_message_level_rules.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Message-level rules control visibility at the message level based on mobile
app user actions and display frequency. For Mobile In-App Message and Mobile
Push campaigns, you can use the message level to define who sees your message
and when.

  * **[Add Mobile Message Targeting Rules](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_mobile_campaign_message_targeting_rules.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
After you create a Mobile In-App Message or Mobile Data campaign, you can add
message rules and promote content in **Message Rules**. Message rules control
when a mobile in-app message shows for a visitor. For example, show the
message when a visitor takes a specific action. Or only show the message a
certain number of times per visit, during a specific time period, or all of
the time. Use Promoted Content to promote a specific item or multiple items
either by selecting the item or by using Einstein Recipes algorithms or
Einstein Decisions AI.
