Check out personalization use cases of email campaigns for financial services.

Personalization Open-Time Email delivers personalized product recommendations
each time a recipient opens an email. It uses your existing email campaigns
and sends notifications through your current Email Service Provider (ESP). You
send email campaigns using the same tools you currently use. To enable
messages to be personalized at open time, you add HTML generated by the Open-
Time email tool.

Using Open-Time Email helps you solve the challenge of personalizing all types
of email at scale, including:

  * one-to-all broad-based commercial calendar campaigns
  * one-to-many targeted segment-specific communications
  * one-to-one automated emails based on high value subscriber events or actions

Assume you've captured the email address of a website visitor and they’ve
qualified for your email campaign stream. You're now able to include up to the
moment, relevant cross channel content within your emails rendered at time of
open. Content populates each time a subscriber opens an email. You ensure that
each individual receives the most up-to-the-moment, relevant content,
regardless of where they are in their customer journey.
