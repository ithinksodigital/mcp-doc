# Use Segments

Use segments to add another layer of personalization to your campaigns, and
gain deeper insight into your customers.

  * **[About Using Segments](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_segment_use_about.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Learn about using segments.

  * **[Export a Segment to the Personalization SFTP](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_segment_export_sftp.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Set up a nightly feed or a one-time export to synchronize segments with the
Personalization SFTP. You can then use these segments in other systems to
target cross-channel communications. For example, you can synchronize a
segment to Marketing Cloud to target a specific group with an email
communication.

  * **[Export Segments to Marketing Cloud](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_segment_export_marketing_cloud.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Configure a process in Marketing Cloud Automation Studio to automatically load
CSV export files from the Personalization system to Marketing Cloud data
extensions. Complete these tasks in sequence.

  * **[Export a Segment as a CSV File](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_segment_export_csv.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Export segment data as a CSV file.

  * **[Export a Segment to Journey Builder](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_segment_export_journey_builder.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
The Personalization system constantly gathers data about your users, your
catalog, and other systems through channel events, API events, and data feeds
to update segments in real time. Use segments to add users to journeys in
Journey Builder within moments of the data changing as they join segments.
Complete the following steps to export a segment to Journey Builder.

  * **[Disable a Scheduled Segment Export](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_segment_scheduled_export_disable.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Stop a scheduled segment export. The Segment File Exporter saves your
configuration so it's easy to enable the sync again.
