# Use Goals

Select a global goal in campaign statistics to display the number and the rate
of goal completions for that global goal. Selecting a goal also adds a
corresponding graph of these values over time below the summary. Global goals
are recorded for all relevant activity from the time they’re created. It’s
important to plan ahead and create goals before the activity you want to
measure occurs.

  1. From the main navigation, in Channels & Campaigns, select the channel the campaign was created for and then select **Campaigns**.
  2. Search for and select the campaign.
  3. Click **Statistics**.
  4. From the **Goal Selection** dropdown, select the global goal to apply to campaign statistics for this campaign. The data recalculates based on your selection.

Note If **Goal Completion Rate** and **Goal Completions** metrics don’t appear
in your campaign stats report, select any metric column name, hover over
**Columns** , and then select the metrics that you want to add.

Example

Suppose 10 visitors saw a campaign. Of those 10 visitors, 2 became high value
customers after seeing the campaign. If you select the global goal of High
Value Customer, campaign statistics show two goal completions and a goal
completion rate of 20%.
