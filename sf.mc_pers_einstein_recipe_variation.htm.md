# Variations in Einstein Recipes

Use variations in Einstein Recipes to modify the recommendations that
Personalization presents so that your customers see a wider array of items.
For example, you can configure a variation to force a recipe to show at most
two items from the same category. So if a customer has an affinity for the
"hats" category, Personalization recommends the two most relevant hats and a
variety of other items from different categories.

Variation  | Description  | Parameters
