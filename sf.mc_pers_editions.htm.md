## Definitions

 _Monthly Unique Visitors_ represents the monthly total number of unique
visitors, which consists of:

  * Web or App SDK visitors
  * Transaction ETL
  * User ETL
  * Profile Object ETL
  * External Email Campaign Event ETL
  * Event API (any that are stitched by identity across two or more of these sources would count as 1 monthly unique visitor)

In general, monthly unique visitors is the total number of unique known and
unknown visitors who visited a website or any other available channel during
the reporting month. Your Marketing Cloud Personalization edition includes a
maximum number of monthly unique visitors. Your limit is calculated as the
average monthly unique visitor count for the past 12 months of your contract
period. Here’s an example of an annual monthly unique visitor calculation:

  * Suppose a website or mobile app has two million monthy unique visitors in January, four million in February, and three million in the remaining 10 months of the year.
  * The monthly unique visitor count for the website from January to December is three million and is an average for the previous 12 months: (2M + 4M + (10 x 3M)) / 12 = 3 million monthly unique visitors

_Named Individual Profile_ is a known, identified profile created through
login events, identification events, or data ingestion. Named profiles are a
cumulative metric equivalent to the total number of unique known users
captured by Marketing Cloud Personalization across all your channels since the
beginning of your contract. Examples of when a Named Individual Profile is
created include:

  * A previously anonymous user logs in for the first time, converting the anonymous profile to a known profile.
  * You upload a database of existing profiles and identifiers.
