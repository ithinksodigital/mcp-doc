# Behavior Report

Use the Behavior report to view the number of new versus returning visitors
based on visits, engagement, logged-in status, and purchases. You can define
the date range and apply one filter to narrow the results by campaign or by
other criteria.

The Behavior report includes these views.

View | Description  
---|---  
Visits | Compares the number of new or returning visitors  
Engagement | Compares overall engagement of visitors  
Logged In | Shows how many visitors were anonymous and how many were logged in, making them known visitors  
Purchased | Compares the number of visitors who purchased with the number of visitors who never purchased (revenue generating only)  
  
Applying a filter narrows the results to make comparisons. For example, you
can see how engagement level affects purchases.
