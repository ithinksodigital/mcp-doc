# Referring Sources Report

Personalization starts the moment a visitor arrives on your site, so you want
to know how they got there. Use the Referring Sources report to view how
people arrived on your site so that you can customize your messaging for each
visitor.

To attract visitors, you can use the information in the Referring Sources
Report. Say for example your highest referring source is Facebook, but it has
the highest bounce rate, and visitors referred by Facebook spend the least
amount of time on your site. You can design a campaign to provide a second-
chance message with a special call to action for those visitors.

The Referring Sources report supports two views.
