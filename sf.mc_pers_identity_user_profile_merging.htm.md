# Merge User Profiles

One of Personalization’s key goals is to identify each of your customers with
a Unified Customer Profile so that you can provide unique personalized
experiences. However, as users engage with your various channels, it’s
possible to end up with multiple user profiles for the same person. When
identity data comes from different sources, Personalization uses specific
identifiers to attempt to merge that data into a Unified Customer Profile.
There’s no way to split a merged user profile.
