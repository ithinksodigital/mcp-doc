You can change the reporting time range to be the previous or the current
week, month, or quarter. When viewing the Goal Completion report, keep the
following in mind:

  * While segments are calculated retroactively, goals are not. 
  * New goals are tracked only after you add them, and they don't include visitors who joined the goal segment before it was defined as a goal. For example, imagine you have a segment created on 9/29 that was made into a goal on 10/2. Visitors that satisfied the condition of the goal between 9/29 and 10/2 arenâ€™t accounted for as it wasn't considered a goal in that time frame.
  * You can select filters from any that you create and from any preconfigured filters available on your site.
