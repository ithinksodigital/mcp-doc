# View Stored Item Images

View images to validate them for each item on the network. Personalization
generates all images in your catalog when you publish an open time item
template, and refreshes individual images when you update the template’s
metadata. However, if an item’s image changes, but the image URL remains the
same, Personalization doesn’t automatically update the image it stores.
