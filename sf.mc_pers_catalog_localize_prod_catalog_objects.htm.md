# Localizing Product and Catalog Objects

Personalization supports catalog item localization for individual datasets.
You can create and store localized data for specific fields based on the
language and country codes that you select for the dataset. For catalog items
containing localized data, you can deliver locale-specific personalization
experiences in the language that matches the customerâ€™s locale.

All catalog objects, except Promotions, support storing localized versions.
Promotion localization is typically handled using localized assets on the
promotion that are then tagged with content zones or tags to enable localized
experiences.

For information about attributes that support localization, see [Product
