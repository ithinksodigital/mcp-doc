## account

In Marketing Cloud Personalization, an account represents a company or
organization that has individuals who engage with your company. For example,
you could have individual users who visit your site who all work for ABC
Company. If you have accounts enabled on your dataset, you can see analytics
by account, activate (personalize) based on account, and view account profile
data.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## account profile

For business-to-business (B2B) clients, a profile built both at the individual
prospect and customer level, and for the account to which these clients
belong. For example, Marketing Cloud Personalization can have:

  * An account profile of ABC Company
  * Individual profiles for anonymous visitors from ABC Company 
  * Named profiles for Bob and Alice from ABC Company 

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## activation

Using the data collected and stored within Marketing Cloud Personalization to
affect a customer experience in some way. Activation is also known as
personalization because it’s the act of using information known about a person
to deliver a personally relevant experience.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## activity

This reporting term gives an overview of campaign and goal statistics,
including trends for impressions, goal completions, and click-throughs. Use
the activity reporting section in Marketing Cloud Personalization to analyze
information about recent visitors, see actions taken by visitors and
customers, group users by cohorts, and see other data.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## activity data

Includes information on pages visited, number and frequency of visits, and
page-level engagement based on mouse movement, scrolling, inactivity, and time
spent.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## anchor

In the recommendations system, the reference point that an ingredient or
exclusion uses as the basis for determining which items to return. For
example, to use a Co-Browse ingredient, set the anchor item. Marketing Cloud
Personalization returns items for what’s being viewed on the page, in the
visitor's cart, last purchased, or purchased by the visitor within a specific
number of days.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## attribute data

Data that is unique to a user or account. Attribute data is collected from
various sources, including:

  * contact forms
  * survey responses on your site
  * external databases such as a CRM, email marketing solution, marketing automation tools, or a data warehouse

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## attribution type

Type of attribution. One of the following:  Type | Description  
---|---  
View | Shows whether visitors saw the campaign and converted during the selected attribution window.  
Click | Shows whether visitors clicked the button or link in the campaign and converted. Applies only to campaigns that include a button or a link.  
  
[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## attribution window

The period between the visit impression and the goal completion of a campaign.
Marketing Cloud Personalization offers four attribution windows: 30 minutes
(default), 1 hour, 24 hours, and 1 week. Because some products have a longer
consideration cycle, review how long the timeline to conversion is, and then
use that time frame when reviewing data.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## audience

Specific individuals, groups of individuals (such as segments), or accounts
(such as companies) that are targeted by personalization campaigns, or who
view them.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## average order value (AOV)

Total revenue collected divided by the number of orders. AOV quantifies the
average basket size of the visitors who saw the campaign and made a purchase
during the attribution window.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## beacon

The Marketing Cloud Personalization JavaScript beacon places a first party cookie on the visitor's browser. The beacon sends data for that visitor back to Marketing Cloud Personalization. Data includes pages visited, links clicked, time on site, number of visits, geolocation, and referral source, as well as other collected custom data. The beacon is integrated in either of two ways:  Approach | Description  
---|---  
Synchronous | Loads the beacon before the page loads. Synchronous integration allows Marketing Cloud Personalization to prevent page flicker, a momentary flash of the original page content.  
Asynchronous | Loads the beacon after the page has loaded. With asynchronous integration, Marketing Cloud Personalization can’t protect against flicker.  
  
[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## Behavior Report

Shows information about visits to your site. You can graph out the number of
visits based on new versus returning visitors, engagement level, logged-in
status, and purchase behaviors. You can apply one filter to adjust the results
and make comparisons.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## booster

You can use boosters to tailor your recommendation recipe to the 1:1 level.
When you use a booster, the visitor's affinity score is considered, and items
that match that affinity are boosted in the recommendations query results. In
other words, if you boosted the brand affinity in your recipe, visitors who
show a preference for a particular brand see items with that brand first.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## call center

Systems that companies use to engage with customers over the phone (for
example, a toll-free number). Using an integration, Marketing Cloud
Personalization can pass data including personalized messages and
recommendations to these systems to help representatives best serve customers.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## campaign

Contains experiences and messages designed to personalize the interaction a
visitor has with your channels (Web campaigns excepted).

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## campaign-level goal

Created for campaigns only. Associated with a specific set of narrow actions.
Use campaign-level goals to avoid exposing visitors to the campaign after
they’ve reached the goal. Visitors who reach the goal don’t see the campaign
again. An example of an effective campaign goal is moving people through
different audience segments. For example, after a visitor watches a getting
started video, they would have completed the campaign goal of “Watched Intro
Video” and wouldn’t see the message again.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## campaign-level rule

Not applicable to Web campaign and experience rules. Rules set at the campaign
level holistically control how the campaign renders. Rules can be based on
particular factors, including:

  * visitor or recipient segments
  * location
  * device type
  * time of day
  * visitor or recipient behaviors
  * company
  * industry

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## campaign state

A campaign can be in one of the following states:  State | Description  
---|---  
Disabled | Set automatically when you create a campaign. A campaign in the disabled state isn’t “live” on your site.  
Testing | To verify a campaign before publishing, change its state to **Testing**.  
Published | When you’re ready to make your campaign live on your site or in your application, change its state to **Published**.  
  
[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## catalog

Collection of products and content, as well as related categories, and tags
(such as brand, gender, style, keyword, and author). Marketing Cloud
Personalization dynamically populates the catalog in real time with product
and content data automatically extracted from the site. You can provide this
information through a data feed, but gathering your data directly from your
site means that your product and content information is always up to date.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## catalog mapping

The process of integrating a site with the Marketing Cloud Personalization
catalog. After the catalog is mapped and Einstein Recipes are implemented,
items from the catalog can be recommended to visitors.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## channel

A touch point used to interact with, and communicate with, visitors and
customers. Depending on your Marketing Cloud Personalization license, you can
access to channels for Web, email, and mobile channels, as well as third-party
channels (integrations with other systems).

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## click action

Occurs when a visitor clicks a button or a link being tracked by Marketing
Cloud Personalization. A click can be a specific action you want to track, or
it can be a button or a link driving visitors to another domain not tracked by
Marketing Cloud Personalization. Example: A Login button that takes visitors
to an application from a marketing site.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## clickthrough

The total number of clickthrough events that occurred in the campaign.
Clickthrough events are tracked only when a campaign has something to click,
such as a button or a link.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## clickthrough rate

The number of clicks divided by the number of impressions. If clickthrough
events are zero, the clickthrough rate is also zero.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## client

A business that uses Marketing Cloud Personalization services.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## co-browse ingredient

The algorithm that analyzes:

  * items or content commonly viewed by previous visitors, along with
  * the same item or content a visitor is viewing, or has placed in their cart

If a visitor is viewing an article, this ingredient returns articles that
other visitors commonly viewed during the same browsing session in which they
viewed that particular article.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## co-buy ingredient

An algorithm that analyzes

  * items or content also purchased or downloaded by previous visitors, along with:
  * the same item the visitor is viewing or has placed in their cart during the lookback period

For example, if a visitor placed a jacket in their cart, this ingredient
returns items that other visitors have commonly bought with that jacket in the
past 30 days.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## collaborative filtering ingredient

Often referred to as the "people like me" algorithm, collaborative filtering
is based on the alternating least squares (ALS) method of matrix
factorization. This ingredient learns visitor intent through browsing and
purchasing behaviors to best match their affinity categories. The ingredient
then clusters the visitor with other visitors that have similar affinities.
The results returned are based on the cluster as a whole.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## comparison baseline

A selection in Campaign Statistics used to compare campaign experiences
against each other or against a control. If experience A is the baseline, then
the revenue or conversion rate can be higher for experience B as compared to
experience A.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## confidence

In Campaign Statistics for an A/B tested campaign, the probability that the
click-through rate for the updated campaign experience will exceed the click-
through rate of the original version (control). For example, if confidence is
95%, the chance of making an error—deciding that the updated experience gets a
higher click-through rate when it doesn’t—is 5%.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## content zone

An area of a site that a developer has configured in the sitemap to make
eligible for personalization. Examples: a homepage hero (personalized offers
or recommendation) or product detail page (PDP) product recommendations row
(similar items on the PDP).

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## contextual data

Data that is passed to Marketing Cloud Personalization when a visitor lands on
a site. Includes:

  * the visitor’s IP address and referring source
  * other information, such as geographical data and device type

Also referred to as implied data.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## conversion rate

The total number of orders or goal completions collected divided by the number
of unique visitors who saw the campaign.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## dataset

In Marketing Cloud Personalization, a collection of events, catalog
configurations, and user profiles. Datasets keep Marketing Cloud
Personalization data separate and organized. An account can have multiple
datasets. Data is partitioned so that data sent to one dataset is kept
separate from data in other datasets. Partitioned data helps clarify distinct
differences in customer engagement.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## decay age

Defines the length of time a product or piece of content remains marked as
new.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## deep behavioral tracking

Provides a picture of each visitor’s true interests and intent based on what’s known about that visitor, including:  Data | Description  
---|---  
situational data | Examples: a visitor's referring site, email or ad campaign source, IP address, geo-location, device type, and operating system.  
attribute data | Collected from contact forms and survey responses on your site, or from external databases such as a CRM, email marketing solution, or a data warehouse.  
activity data | Examples: pages visited, number and frequency of visits, and page-level of engagement based on mouse movement, scrolling, inactivity, and time spent.  
contextual data | Context of each page, such as category, brand, style, and keywords.  
  
[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## dismissal

The number of times a message was dismissed using the close icon.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## dismissal rate

The number of dismissals divided by the number of impressions.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## display frequency

A message-level rule that limits the number of times to display a message:

  * a specific interval
  * all-time
  * during a visitor's current visit

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## Einstein Decisions

Feature that determines which factors to train in the machine learning models
responsible for serving up recommendations. After it’s configured, Einstein
Decisions analyzes these factors for each visitor to determine which
promotions to show based on which are expected to generate the most lift.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## Einstein Recipe

Recommendation strategy in Marketing Cloud Personalization. You build recipes
by adding one or more ingredients—or the core algorithms driving the recipe—as
well as exclusions, and boosters. You can create a variety of combinations to
serve up the right content or products based on an individual visitor’s
behavior and affinities on your site.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## entrance action

An option in the Path report. The Path report shows the number of actions
recorded for the page you selected in the dropdown, the bounce rate for this
page, and the path for that page.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## event

Any interaction a visitor has with a site, such as a click, a page load, or a
message view (which is an impression).

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## exclusion

Designates whether to show items in a recommendation. Usage examples:

  * Tailor a recipe to avoid recommending products that are in the cart.
  * Include items in the same category as what each visitor is viewing.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## experience

Use experiences to create different personalization results within the same
campaign. For example, suppose you want to create a campaign for first-time
visitors to your site. You want to show different message to visitors from
Boston and San Francisco because you have events coming up in those two
cities. To implement this approach, create three experiences in the same
campaign:

  * Boston visitors
  * San Francisco visitors
  * visitors from everywhere else

Use experience-level rules to control the visibility of these experiences

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## explicit data

Data that a visitor provides intentionally, such as survey responses, purchase
history, content downloads, or clicks.

[](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US)

## filter

Used with segments or global goals. Apply filters to the data shown in
campaign statistics and some reports. When you apply a filter, only the people
who meet the filter condition are included in the metrics. For example, you
can compare how first-time and repeat visitors performed for a campaign, so
you can cater experiences to each group. Or, you can see if your campaign is
performing well on all devices, or only on mobile, or only on desktops. In
addition to any filters you configure for your dataset, there are a number of
pre-existing – or default – filters available for reporting and campaign
statistics.
