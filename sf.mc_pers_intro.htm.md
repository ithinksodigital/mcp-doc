# Introduction to Personalization

Get introduced to Salesforce Marketing Cloud Personalization.

## What is Marketing Cloud Personalization?

Marketing Cloud Personalization provides real-time, scalable, cross-channel
personalization and AI to complement Marketing Cloud Engagement’s robust
customer data, audience segmentation, and engagement platform. Using tailored
interactions with customers and prospects, increase loyalty, engagement, and
conversions. Also, deliver more relevant experiences during interactions
across the customer journey. For more information, see [Personalization
Defined: What is
Personalization?](https://www.salesforce.com/resources/articles/personalization-
definition/)

## Unified Profiles

Personalization helps you understand each visitor by building a centralized
individual profile from different data sources. Personalization provides a
visual representation of all the data about a single visitor, including
preferences and affinities. Use this information to decide on how and when to
best interact with them on the channels they use. You can roll this profile up
to the account level to view the relationships among visitor behaviors
associated with the same account.

## Framework for Real-time Interaction Management

To help you manage and act on customer data, use Personalization to:

Goal | Description  
---|---  
Integrate | Gather data about your customers and place it in Personalization.  
Understand | Know your customers better after Personalization builds each customer’s Unified Customer Profile (UCP) from many sources.  
Decide | Determine the best way to engage with customers cross-channel.  
Engage | Interact with each customer on the channel they prefer and with the frequency they want.  
Analyze | Examine your customer’s journey data and find the most effective communication channels, promotions, and connections.  
  
## Browser Support

Personalization browser support generally aligns with Marketing Cloud
Engagement [browser
support](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_overview_graded_browser_support.htm&language=en_US&type=5).
Exceptions include:

Exception | Description  
---|---  
Visual Editor | Personalization tests the Visual Editor with Google Chrome. If you use the Visual Editor in other browsers, full functionality can’t be guaranteed.  
Web Integration | For proper web tracking, the Marketing Cloud Personalization module of the Salesforce Interactions SDK requires native Promise support in the end user’s browser. Most browsers support this functionality. However, Internet Explorer, which was retired in 2022, doesn’t provide native Promise support. Therefore, for web integration, Internet Explorer isn’t a supported end-user browser. For web users who use ad blockers, an ad blocker set to highly restrictive settings can block personalized experiences. For more information, see [Marketing Cloud Personalization Web Integration](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/marketing/personalization/guide/web-integration.html).
