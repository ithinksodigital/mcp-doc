# Configure Personalization Gears

The gears framework in Marketing Cloud Personalization allows you to integrate
Personalization with other systems, take advantage of reusable templates, and
access the rich analytics data stored in Marketing Cloud Personalization. You
can enable or disable individual gears. For some gears, you can configure gear
settings in the UI.

  1. In the main navigation menu, hover over **Gears** and select **Gears**. 

The Installed Gears screen displays a list of installed gears, including its
name, a description, its status (enabled or disabled), and category.

  2. Navigate to the gear that you want to configure.

Note Changing a gear setting in the UI is a no-code way to influence gear
behavior. Configuring gears in the UI differs from customizing gears used in
campaign templates, which requires coding (as described in [Custom Interface
and Template
Configuration](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/marketing/personalization/guide/custom-
interface-template-configuration.html)).
