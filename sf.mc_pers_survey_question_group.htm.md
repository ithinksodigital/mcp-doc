# Group Survey Questions Together

You can group survey questions together into sections and add visibility rules
to each section by creating a panel. For example, you can group similar
questions together and title the panel so the respondent understands how
theyâ€™re related.

You can use the visibility setting to make a question invisible or apply visibility conditions. Visibility conditions always take priority over the visibility setting. With visibility conditions, you can make questions appear only if respondents answer in a certain way. For example, only show a follow-up question if the respondent gave a specific answer to the initial question.").
