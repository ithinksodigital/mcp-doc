# Unified Customer Profile for SaaS

The Unified Customer Profile provides an overview of all information that
Marketing Cloud Personalization collects about a particular user. The
information that displays depends on the type of business you select (SaaS).

When you have your site set up to display the Unified Customer Profile for a
SaaS business, Marketing Cloud Personalization displays the following
information.

## User Snapshot

The user snapshot section at the top of the Unified Customer Profile gives a
quick overview of the user that includes:

Item | Description  
---|---  
User’s name | The unique identifier for a user—a user, ID, email address, person’s name, or a generic label for an anonymous user.  
Average pages per visit | The average number of pages the user views in the application during each visit  
Average minutes per visit | The average number of minutes the user is active in the application for each visit  
Average visits per week | The average number of times the user opens the application each week  
Location | The town or city; state, province, or region; and country for the user  
  
## Engagement Graph

The engagement graph at the top of the Unified Customer Profile provides a visual representation of the user’s engagement and actions. The circle displays four color-coded components that Personalization uses to define the engagement score—visits, actions, KPIs, and segments. You configure these components by selecting **Settings** | **Engagement** from the bottom section of the main navigation.

## Visit History

The timeline in the middle of the Unified Customer Profile displays the user’s
visits to your website for all time. You can hover over a visit to view its
date and duration.

Hovering over a visit adds an orange highlight. Multiple visits on the same
day overlap. You can drag across the timeline to zoom in on a particular
period. Clicking **All Time Visits** returns you to the zoomed out view.

## Detail Tabs

The tabs at the bottom of the Unified Customer Profile provide additional
details about the user, including:

Item | Description  
---|---  
Overview | Includes user details, such as the user ID, username, email address, lifetime value, and last visit, and any identity attributes or other associated attributes. The vertical actions timeline appears on the Overview tab, and lists all actions the user completed in the application during the indicated period, starting with the most recent. If the user visited the application multiple times on the same day, it appears multiple times in the timeline. An arrow icon indicates the user clicked the listed action. A page icon indicates the user viewed the listed page.  
Event Stream | Lists all actions and visited URLs, and the date of each. Selecting an entry provides more details.  
Action Details | Lists the user’s tracked actions for your site.  
Segment Compare | Provides details about the user when compared across your site and with any additional segments you add from the **Select a segment** dropdown. You can toggle between **Averages** and **Totals** data for the user.  
Segment Membership | Lists the segments the user is a member of.  
Profile Objects | Displays a table of all configured profile objects and their associated metadata (attributes and related catalog objects). Each tab of the table corresponds to a single profile object. If a profile object has an association with a related catalog object, that value appears as a hyperlink in the table so you can navigate to it.
