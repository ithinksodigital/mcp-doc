# Filter Strategy and Planning

Create filters for use with reporting and campaign statistics, or use any
default filters.

Several default filters are available for you to use in reporting and campaign
statistics, in addition to any you configured for your dataset. When you apply
a filter, only the people who meet the filter category are included in the
metrics.

Filters are recorded for all relevant activity from the time they’re created.
With a default filter, you can see how first-time and repeat visitors
performed for a campaign, so you can cater experiences to them. Or you can see
how your campaign is performing on all devices, or only on mobile or only on
desktop. It’s important to plan ahead and create filters before the activity
you want to measure occurs.
