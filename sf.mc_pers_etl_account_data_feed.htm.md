# Account ETL Data Feed

Use the Account ETL data feed to update account information in Unified Account
Profiles.

## About Ingesting Account Data

If you market to businesses, you can use Unified Account Profiles to display
aggregate information that Personalization collects about a particular
account. Unified Account Profiles provide a comprehensive view of each of your
accounts according to the cross-channel interactions of customers and
prospects.

The accounts can be linked with firmographic data to gain more information.
Any previously known information about the accounts can be loaded into the
system by creating attributes to reflect the keys in the source system. Custom
attributes can also be defined.

## Requirements

  * ETL files must be in a CSV file format that adheres to the schema for the data feed. Files that donâ€™t follow the file naming conventions or the appropriate schema result in errors and fail to process.
  * Field names that begin with `attribute:` must match the custom attribute names on the Account Attributes tab of the Settings > Attributes page.
