# Campaign Statistics Filters

Use campaign statistics filters to focus on how various subgroups behave in a
campaign. You can view statistics based on selected results filters, tailor
statistics output to account for outliers, view statistics by attribution and
activity, or compare baselines.

Filtering Option | Description  
---|---  
Outlier Filtering | This option is available if you configured outliers for the Catalog and Profile objects. If you turn on Outlier Filtering, you exclude outliers in campaign statistics. For example, a visitor placing an order significantly higher in value than the average order can skew the statistics for your campaign. Outlier filtering can exclude this order, resulting in a more accurate view of campaign performance.  
Results Filter | Select a results filter to view campaign statistics only for visitors that meet the filter criteria. For example, the First Visit filter excludes visitors who didnâ€™t complete the campaign as a first-time visitor. To see if campaign performance varies between devices, use the Device Type filter. You can also apply a segment that is configured as a filter.  
Attribution Type | The two attribution types are view and click. View shows conversions from visitors who received a campaign impression during the selected time frame. Click shows conversions from visitors who click any tracked, clickable element of the campaign.  
Attribution Window | The attribution window is the time period between visit impression and goal completion. The time period that you choose depends on how quickly you expect a visitor to convert after exposure to the campaign. For example, 30 minutes (the default) is the typical attribution window for a campaign designed to drive an immediate response, such as an email capture popup.  
Comparison Baseline | You can compare campaign metrics against a baseline. For example, you can compare one experience to another or to a control experience to see which has a higher revenue or conversion rate.
