# Create Segments

There are many ways in which you can create a segment.

  * **[Create a Segment](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_segment_create.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
A segment is a real-time grouping of users, or accounts, based on criteria you
define using a set of segment categories and rules.

  * **[Clone a Segment](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_segment_clone.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
You can clone a segment so you can reuse all or part of it in another
campaign. This approach saves you time because you don't have to create an
entire segment.

  * **[Create A/B Test Segments](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_segment_a_b_test.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Use A/B test segments for tasks like wanting to ensure a user falls into a
specific segment across multiple campaigns, or to split campaign traffic into
intervals, such as halves, thirds, or quarters.

  * **[Create a Segment Based on Account Profile Attributes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_segment_create_account_profile.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Use account profile attributes to create segments for your campaigns that
target accounts based on those attributes. This feature is available only if
your account is set up to market to businesses.

  * **[Create a Segment Based on a Specific Action Count](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_segment_create_action_count.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Create segments for your campaigns to target users who complete one or more
actions a specific number of times. To capture users who complete an action a
specific number of times, create two action rules that relate to each other.

  * **[Create a Segment Based on User Location](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_segment_create_user_location.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Create segments for your campaigns to target users based on location, such as
their ZIP codes, cities, regions, countries, and ISPs. If you have B2B Detect,
you can use location-based segments to target visitors from specific companies
and industries. Location-based segments are also helpful in understanding the
data that the Personalization system captures about your site.

  * **[Create a Segment Based on User Profile Attributes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_segment_create_user_profile.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Use user profile attributes to create segments for your campaigns and target
users based on those attributes.

  * **[Create a Segment Based on Third-Party Integrations](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_segment_create_third_party_integration.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Create segments for your campaigns using any third-party integrations you have
set up within the Personalization system.

  * **[Create a Segment Based on B2B Detect Data](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_segment_create_b2b_detect.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Create segments for your campaigns that target users according to IP data
sources and NAICS industry codes. This feature is available only with B2B
Detect. Using B2B Detect, you can create personalized calls-to-action, case
studies, and banner images based on a userâ€™s industry or company name. You use
three location rules to create the segment for B2B Detect data.

  * **[Create Manual Segments](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_segment_manual.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Manual segments consist of a fixed, specified list of users, as opposed to
rule-based segments, whose users are determined in real time based on a
defined set of criteria.

  * **[Create a Nested Segment](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_segment_create_nested.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
A nested segment is a segment that excludes or includes at least one existing
segment. You can combine segments into a nested segment by selecting at least
one existing segment to use as an exclusion or inclusion.
