# Content Zones

A content zone is an area on your website configured to be available for
personalization in a web campaign. A developer defines content zones in the
sitemap for your site. You use content zones to display text, images, buttons,
and input fields. Examples of content zones include a homepage hero, a popup,
and an infobar.

Here are some examples of content zones.
