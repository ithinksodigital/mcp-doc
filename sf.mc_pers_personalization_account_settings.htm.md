# Personalization Account Settings

During your Marketing Cloud Personalization implementation, your development
and marketing teams work with your Salesforce account manager to configure the
Personalization account settings for your organization. Within those settings,
you define and configure your data model and integration setup. You can then
access and adjust key configurations.

permissions.

  * **[Personalization Datasets](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_datasets.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Marketing Cloud Personalization datasets are collections of events, catalog
configurations, and user profiles that keep your Personalization data separate
and organized. Within your Personalization account, you can set up multiple
datasets. Data within one dataset is separate from data in other datasets so
that you can analyze customer engagement differently.

  * **[Personalization IP Addresses](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_personalization_ip_addresses.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Marketing Cloud Personalization uses several IP addresses that you can flag to
allow access for security reasons, or to exclude from data consumption
tracking.

  * **[Personalization API Tokens](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_api_tokens.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Marketing Cloud Personalization uses API tokens to authenticate and authorize
all API requests to Personalization's REST API.

  * **[View the Personalization Audit Log](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_audit_log_viewing.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Administrators can use Marketing Cloud Personalization’s Audit Log to view
access and activity records in support of compliance and investigation
efforts. The Audit Log includes events related to authentication, user
management, API token management, campaigns, templates, catalog
configurations, and other activity for a dataset.

  * **[Block Internal Traffic from Logs](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_logs_blocking_internal_traffic.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
You can block internal traffic and behavior from Marketing Cloud
Personalization’s logs. For example, you can block internal users who log in
to your customer's portals, such Customer Success employees logging in for
training. Blocking is by user ID, which can differ from username and email
address.
