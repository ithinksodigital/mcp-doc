# Add Mobile Message Targeting Rules

After you create a Mobile In-App Message or Mobile Data campaign, you can add
message rules and promote content in **Message Rules**. Message rules control
when a mobile in-app message shows for a visitor. For example, show the
message when a visitor takes a specific action. Or only show the message a
certain number of times per visit, during a specific time period, or all of
the time. Use Promoted Content to promote a specific item or multiple items
either by selecting the item or by using Einstein Recipes algorithms or
Einstein Decisions AI.

on frequency or after performing an action. For example, you can configure the
message to appear only if the user adds an item to the shopping cart. For more
