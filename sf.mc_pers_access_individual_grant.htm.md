# Grant Personalization Access to an Individual Salesforce Employee

You can authorize individual Salesforce Customer Support employees to access
your site to assist with support, configuration, and strategy. Add each
individual separately, and customize the role and duration. After the selected
duration is over, you can grant access again. Salesforce employees who have
