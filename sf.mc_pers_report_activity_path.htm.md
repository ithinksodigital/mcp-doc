For each page type, you can see which pages a visitor went to next and whether
that was the end of their interaction. For example, suppose visitors
frequently abandon your demo request form. Based on the Paths report, you can
see that they go to one of four other pages. You can message them about the
demo on those four pages to increase demo sign ups. Also, if no one enters
your site on the homepage, donâ€™t offer a Getting Started video on that page.

To see where a visitor went after completing an action, select or enter the
action. You can see the bounce percentage and the percentage of visitors who
remained on the page after completing the action. The list of pages shows
where visitors who remained on the page went next. To see details about a
selected page, click the page in the list. Continue to select pages to see the
path visitors take as they move through your site.
