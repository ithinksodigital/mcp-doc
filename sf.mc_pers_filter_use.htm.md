Use filters to view data on a more granular level. You can apply filters to
data in certain reports or in campaign statistics.

You can select filters from any that you configure and from the preconfigured
filters available on your site. You can also select a predefined Reporting
Time Range to narrow the report to a time period such as:

  * Current or previous week

  * Current or previous month

  * Current or previous quarter

You create filters from segments or global goals. You can apply filters to the
data you see in certain reports or in campaign statistics. When you apply a
filter to campaign statistics or a report, only the visitors who meet the
filter category are included in the metrics. Filters are recorded for all
relevant activity from the time they’re created. It’s important to plan ahead
and create filters before the activity you want to measure occurs.

Several reports give you the option to apply a filter. Filters enable you to
view data on a more granular level. For example:

  * To see what browser type customers who purchased more than $100 used, create and apply a Purchase > 100 filter to the Technology report.

  * Using the Revenue report, view the revenue from two different customer groups based on how they interacted with a specific email campaign or with all email campaigns.

  * Apply a filter to see the difference in engagement between new and returning visitors using the Behavior Report.

To gain more insights into your data, use filters in reports or for campaign
statistics. For example:

  1. View a report using a filter:
    1. From the main navigation, select **Reports**.
    2. Select a report that includes the option to add a filter, for example the Visits Behavior report.
    3. Click the **No Filter Selected** field**** and choose a filter.The report recalculates based on your selection.
  2. Use a filter on the **Campaign Statistics** screen to limit the statistics to only the activity of visitors matching the selected filter:
    1. From the main navigation, click a channel from the Channels & Campaigns section, and select the campaigns option for the channel. For example, select **Web Campaigns** from the Web channel.
    2. Locate and select an individual campaign from one of the folders.
    3. Click **Statistics**.A statistics page opens for the campaign.
    4. From the **Results Filter** dropdown, select the filter to apply to campaign statistics for this campaign. The data recalculates based on your selection.
