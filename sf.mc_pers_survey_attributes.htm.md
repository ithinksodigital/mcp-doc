When you create and save a survey, Personalization creates a survey attribute
for each survey question in the dataset. The number of survey attributes are
limited per dataset. For more information, see [Personalization
Limits](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_limits.htm&language=en_US&type=5
"Learn about the limits and capabilities in Marketing Cloud
Personalization.").

Responses to survey questions are stored on each respondentâ€™s user profile on
the Survey Responses tab. The Survey Responses tab is available on user
profiles only for users who answer at least one survey question. You can use
survey responses to build segments of users who provide certain answers to
each question. For more information see, [Create a Segment Based on User
Profile
Attributes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_segment_create_user_profile.htm&language=en_US&type=5
"Use user profile attributes to create segments for your campaigns and target
users based on those attributes.").
