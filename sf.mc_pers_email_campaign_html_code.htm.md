Note Depending on your email marketing service, you might need only the URLs
of your Open Time Email campaign rather than the HTML code that
Personalization generates.

  4. When your email template is complete, test it in your email marketing service with the same users you used to simulate email content. Make sure that your test group contains representative profiles similar to your opt-in list so you can realistically simulate the results.
