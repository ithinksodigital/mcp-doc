# Manual Segment Usage

Use manual segments to group known users, or accounts, based on data that the
Personalization system doesn’t collect, or data that’s available through
third-party integrations.

Typically, you create a manual segment when you want to target a group of
users using a variable that the Personalization system doesn’t track. For
example, suppose you’re hosting a live event and want to customize your
website for event attendees. You create a manual segment connecting the
Personalization system to your tracking system by a common data point, such as
attendee email address.

Other examples where a manual segment can be helpful include:

  * Targeting attendees of a recent trade show or webinar.
  * Targeting users on a particular mailing list.
  * Targeting a group to use as an input for an engagement score.
  * Setting a manual segment as a filter for campaign measurement.

Note You can’t use manual segments as goals in the Personalization system.
