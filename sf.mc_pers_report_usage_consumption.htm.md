# Consumption Report

Use the Consumption report to track org-wide total and dataset-specific
consumption metrics. The metrics include monthly unique visitors, named
individual profiles, batch export and import of data, cross-channel triggers,
campaign responses, and events.

By tracking consumption metrics, you can:

  * Understand org and dataset usage of the Personalization product, and better manage your current product consumption.
  * Gain insights and visibility into potentially problematic implementations. By tracking your consumption metrics, you can better understand your current customer base and anticipate growth.
  * Ensure that you’re using a product effectively across various areas by managing limits. If your consumption metrics are greater than your currently allocated volumes, you can proactively modify your implementations to improve entitlement usage.

Marketing Cloud Personalization Growth and Premium editions come with base
consumption volumes. As your business needs change, you can add to your
entitlements.

The Consumption report shows these metrics tables.
