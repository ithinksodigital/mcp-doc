# Example Sitemaps

The following is a list of example Personalization Sitemaps we've created for
different types of business websites that depict how you could approach
designing a Sitemap for your Personalization implementation. The JavaScript
and HTML code in these example Sitemaps are for reference purposes only but
can give you a head start in developing the Sitemap for your implementation.

The sitemap code examples in these articles are only for demonstration
purposes. Avoid copying sample code into your Sitemap Editor as it is built
around example scenarios that can differ from your implementation's goals and
use cases.
