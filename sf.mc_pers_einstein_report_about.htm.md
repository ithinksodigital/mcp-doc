Each Einstein Report includes the following sections:

## Content Zone Description

Each Einstein Decisions training session is for a single content zone. This
section of the report lists the content zone thatâ€™s currently being trained,
along with its associated promotions that have assets mapped to the content
zone.

## Training Data

This section provides a quick summary of the data that Einstein Decisions has
collected. This data offers insight into how active Einstein Decisions has
been, and how much training data it has to work with.

## Historical Performance

This section describes how well your promotions achieved their purpose, and
how effective they are overall. Metrics demonstrate how well Einstein
Decisions performed each day in comparison to just showing random promotions.

## Training

During each training session, Einstein Decisions trains several candidate
machine learning models from your data. When each model is trained,
Personalization evaluates them against each other to determine which model is
most likely to provide the best business value as defined by your training
target.

## Deployment

After you select a model for the model training step, Personalization deploys
the model and makes it live. The selected model appears in this section.
