# Configure Einstein Decisions

Einstein Decisions analyzes many unique data points when determining the right
experience to present to a particular user. This data includes user behaviors
as well as contextual data, such as device type, time of day, and demographic
data. Einstein Decisions can also reference segment membership and user
attribute data, along with catalog objects you create in your catalog. To
determine which data Einstein Decisions references, you define the machine
learning features on the Feature Engineering page. Typically, a data science
or analytics team member configures the feature engineering options for
Einstein Decisions.
