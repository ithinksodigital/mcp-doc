# Hotel Gear Integration

The Hotel Gear is a data model you can use to feed data from your hotel
booking systems into Marketing Cloud Personalization. You can use the data for
segmentation, as well as for campaign and promotion targeting.

  * **[About the Hotel Gear](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_hotel_gear_about.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
The Hotel Gear is part of the Personalization ETL framework for ETL (extract,
transform, and load data) jobs. The Hotel Gear includes two ETLs (Booking and
Booking Add-Ons) and a set of rules available for segmentation, campaign, and
promotion targeting.

  * **[Activate the Hotel Gear](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_hotel_gear_activate.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Activate the Hotel Gear to bring in data from your hotel booking systems. The
Hotel Gear is dataset-specific, so you must activate it for each dataset that
has campaigns or promotions that you want to target with booking system data.
You send booking system data by the Booking ETL data feed.

  * **[Booking ETL](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_hotel_gear_etl.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
You can send data from your hotel booking system to Personalization using the
Booking ETL data feed.

  * **[Booking Add-On ETL](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_hotel_gear_booking_add_on.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
You can send booking add-on transaction data from your hotel booking system to
Personalization using the Booking Add-On ETL.

  * **[Hotel Rules](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_hotel_gear_hotel_rule.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Use hotel rules for web and server-side campaign targeting, or for segmenting
customers. You can group or target customers based on traveler details. For
example, hotel rules can consider travel party size, booking status, scheduled
check-in or check-out time, number of nightsâ€™ stay over a time range, or add-
ons purchased.
