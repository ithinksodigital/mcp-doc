# Test a Web Campaign

Use the campaign testing mode to test your campaigns before you publish them
to ensure they display the way you intend.

Campaign testing mode adheres to all campaign- and experience-level rules,
including A/B testing setup. Because the test mode functions as though the
campaign is published and visible to your intended audience, it’s possible
that your user account doesn’t qualify to see it. So a blank page can display,
which doesn’t indicate that the campaign isn’t working.

  1. Navigate to your website that has the campaign you want to test.
  2. Click the **Extensions** icon in your browser’s toolbar and select **Salesforce Interactions SDK Launcher**. 
  3. Enable the **Campaign Debugger** option.
  4. Click the **Evergage Tools** tab that appears on the side of the browser window.
  5. Enter the campaign name you want to test into the **Search Campaigns** field.
  6. Select the campaign from the list that appears.
  7. Enable the **Testing Mode** option.
  8. Click **Apply**.
  9. Your site reloads with the campaign, applying all campaign- and experience-level rules.
