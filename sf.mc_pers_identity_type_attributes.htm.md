# Identity Types and Attributes

Personalization’s identity system uses deterministic matching to create a
Unified Customer Profile for each of your customers. Specific identifiers,
called identity types, determine how to process web events, API events, and
channel events to identify users from various sources. Personalization
includes several built-in identity types, such as email address and customer
ID. If the built-in identity types don’t meet the needs of your organization,
you can create additional identity types.

Identity types are specific identifiers that determine how Personalization
processes web events, API events, and channel events to identify users from
various sources. Personalization includes several built-in identity types,
such as email address and customer ID. The built-in identity types don’t
require configuration other than setting up event capture mechanisms, such as
the sitemap or ETL jobs.

Personalization includes several built-in identity types, such as email
address and customer ID. However, if the built-in identity types don’t meet
the needs of your organization, you can create three additional identity
types. After you create an identity type, you can’t edit it or delete it.
