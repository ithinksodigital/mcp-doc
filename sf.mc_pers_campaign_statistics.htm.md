Use Campaign Statistics to measure the impact of your campaigns. The
information available on the Campaign Statistics screen helps you analyze
where you can make campaign changes to improve results.

Use campaign statistics filters to focus on how various subgroups behave in a

campaign activity.

insight into campaign performance by specific metric.

Monitor and analyze the effectiveness of a campaign. You can apply different
filters to view activity and attribution metrics during a particular time
period. To collect statistics, the campaign must have recorded campaign
impressions.

Confidence on the Campaign Statistics screen refers to the term statistical
confidence. It’s a measure of how sure you are of your results from an A/B
test. It isn’t a measure of how effective a campaign was, but a measure of how
certain you can be with the campaign’s displayed impact.
