Make the most out of your Personalization campaigns using Guardian.

  * **[About Guardian](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_guardian_about.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Guardian continuously monitors thousands of metrics that it gathers from your
site, web application, or mobile app. It uses these metrics to discover
current trends, identify potential issues, and surface optimization
opportunities. Guardian is part of Personalization, so there’s nothing to set
up or configure for it to recognize what's important to your business.

  * **[Guardian Metric Types](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_guardian_metric_types.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Personalization’s Guardian constantly monitors your site for several metrics.
Understanding what Guardian is measuring is critical to understanding the
information it displays about your site or your app.

  * **[Use Guardian Topics](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_guardian_topic_view.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Guardian topics are groups of user behaviors that Guardian uses to predict
positive or negative impacts on your website.

  * **[View Guardian Signals](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_guardian_signal_view.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Signals are Guardian’s way of alerting you when a metric falls outside of a
predicted range for the seasonal daily and weekly activity for your site and
dataset. Using signals, Guardian can provide either positive or negative
indications of how metrics are impacting your digital property.

  * **[Adjust Guardian Notification Settings](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_guardian_notification_settings_adjust.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
You can adjust Guardian notification settings to customize the email alerts
you receive based on what’s most important to you. Guardian automatically
sends notification emails to anyone @mentioned using the Add Comment feature
for any metrics.
