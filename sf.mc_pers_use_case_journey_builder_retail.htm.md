Tip [](https://help.salesforce.com/s?language=en_US) New to Marketing Cloud
Personalization and Journey Builder integration? If you haven’t sent segment
data from Marketing Cloud Personalization to Journey Builder before, refer to
the Triggered Campaign Use Cases instead. They offer all the Journey Builder
use case functionality plus additional real-time use cases that Journey
Builder use cases don’t support.

Note Segment Join is based on real-time user events tracked by Marketing Cloud
Personalization. Sending a user to Journey Builder upon segment join doesn’t
support the segment join that occurs during the daily segment refresh.

Marketing Cloud Personalization:

  * Listens through web, mobile, API, and data feeds
  * Constantly gathers data about visitors, your catalog, and other systems
  * Updates existing Marketing Cloud Personalization segments and adding any new segment members to Journey Builder in real time

You can use segments to add prospects and customers to Journey Builder
Journeys within moments of data changes.

Use Open-Time Email to personalize the content within each email at the point
that it’s opened by the recipient, further enhancing the real-time nature of
your personalization across multiple channels.

For example, you could create a segment of visitors who view a specific
category or brand, then trigger a journey, which includes Open-Time Email
content recommendations for these segment members. Or pass the details of
visitors who sign up for your loyalty program then email your thanks for
signing up and include recommended products based on their affinity, through
Open-Time email.
