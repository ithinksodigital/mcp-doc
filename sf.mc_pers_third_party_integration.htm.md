# Integrate Personalization with Third-Party Solutions

Marketing Cloud Personalization integrates with third-party applications so
you can share business data outside Salesforce and across multiple venues.

  * **[About Integrating with Third-Party Solutions](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_third_party_integration_about.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Marketing Cloud Personalization integrates with a variety of third-party
solutions (external to Salesforce). Integration options include data
management platforms, email service providers, third-party campaign detection
products, analytics products, content management systems, social media, and
tag managers.

  * **[UTM Parameter Mapping](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_third_party_utm_parameter_mapping.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
UTM parameters are customizable codes that you use in URLs and links to track
and measure the success of various aspects of your third-party campaigns. UTM
parameters can track traffic, referral sources, external campaigns, keywords,
and content zones.

  * **[Configure a Third-Party Integration](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_third_party_configure.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
By integrating with third-party products, you can synchronize user information
that you collect and store in other applications to deliver real-time
personalized experiences across channels. Specifically, this type of
integration focuses on tracking incoming clicks from external, or third party,
campaigns but not impressions.

  * **[View and Edit External Campaigns](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_third_party_external_campaign.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
After you create an external campaign for a third-party product integration,
external campaigns appear in the Uncategorized folder as users begin arriving
at a landing page. The external campaigns have click-throughs, but not
impressions because Personalization doesnâ€™t track impressions for external
campaigns. Only the first event of a visit counts toward third-party campaign
attribution.
