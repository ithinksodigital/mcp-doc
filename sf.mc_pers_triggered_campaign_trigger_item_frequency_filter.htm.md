Example

A customer shows interest in an out-of-stock product. When the item is back in
stock, their viewing behavior triggers a campaign that puts them on a Journey
Builder journey. Two days later, the product is out of stock again. Some time
later, itâ€™s back in stock. You use the Trigger Item Frequency Filter to
prevent users from seeing multiple back-in-stock emails about the same
product.
