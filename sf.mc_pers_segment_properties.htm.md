# Segment Properties

A segment is a real-time grouping of users, or accounts, based on criteria you
define using a set of segment categories and rules. With segments, you can add
another layer of personalization to your campaigns, and gain deeper insight
into your customers.

To view the details for a segment, you select **User Segments** | **User Segments** from the main navigation, and select the desired segment. Hovering over a column displays three stacked dots that you can click to select options for sorting and displaying additional columns. The pane at the bottom of the page provides an overview of the segment, lists the campaigns that are using it, and gives its history. Clicking **Details** provides additional information.

Note If your dataset is configured to support accounts, you also have the option to select **Account Segments** | **Account Segments** and view the details for those segments.

These tabs provide detailed information about a segment.

You can hover over the rings to view affinities for that category.This tab is available only for retail and ecommerce sites.
