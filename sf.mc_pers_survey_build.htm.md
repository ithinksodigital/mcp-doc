# Build Surveys

Use surveys in web campaigns to ask your site visitors questions and gather
feedback.

  * **[Create a Survey](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_survey_create.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Create a survey for a web campaign.

  * **[Clone a Survey](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_survey_clone.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Cloning saves time building a survey. Cloning also preserves the data
integrity of a live survey that needs updates.

  * **[Edit a Survey](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_survey_edit.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
You can edit a survey to add questions, change answers, and make configuration
and layout changes.

  * **[Add Pages to a Survey](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_survey_page.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
You can add pages to a survey.

  * **[Change Survey Navigation Behavior](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_survey_navigation.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
You can control how survey navigation buttons appear and behave. You can also
change how the survey behaves when respondents click a navigation button.

  * **[Change the Layout of Survey Answers](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_survey_layout.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
You can display radio group and checkbox answers horizontally or vertically
and choose the order answers appear. You can also set conditions that
determine when a question is visible to a respondent.

  * **[Require Question Completion](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_survey_question_require.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
You can require respondents to complete questions.

  * **[Group Survey Questions Together](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_survey_question_group.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
You can group survey questions together into sections and add visibility rules
to each section by creating a panel. For example, you can group similar
questions together and title the panel so the respondent understands how
theyâ€™re related.

  * **[Add Question Visibility Conditions](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_survey_question_visibility_condition.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
All survey questions are visible to all visitors who qualify to see the survey
campaign. You can use the visibility setting to make a question invisible or
apply visibility conditions. Visibility conditions always take priority over
the visibility setting. With visibility conditions, you can make questions
appear only if respondents answer in a certain way. For example, only show a
follow-up question if the respondent gave a specific answer to the initial
question.

  * **[View Survey Attributes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_survey_attributes.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Explore survey attributes associated with survey questions.
