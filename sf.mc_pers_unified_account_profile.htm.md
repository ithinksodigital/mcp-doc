Account profile attributes can collect data you can use in segmentation,
reporting, or with integrated third-party systems. For example, if you create
a form in Personalization, you can assign each field to an existing attribute.
Depending on the configuration of your dataset, the attributes can either
collect the data for reporting, or can write it to a third-party integrated
system.
