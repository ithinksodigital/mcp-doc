# Slide-In with Call-to-Action Web Campaigns

Slide-ins enter a web page from the bottom-right corner, and subtly present a
message to the users of your website. Use the built-in global template or use
a custom template that a developer creates.

## Slide-In with Call-to-Action Web Template

The slide-in template available to you can differ in name and configuration
options due to modifications by your developer. If you need additional styling
or configuration options, ask your template developer about modifying the
template.

**Slide-In with Call-to-Action** —Select this template to display a message
that slides in from the bottom-right corner of the screen, and contains a
call-to-action button.

**Trigger Options** | The following behaviors can trigger a slide-in campaign: 

  * **Time on Page (Delay)** —Defines the number of seconds that a user must be on the targeted page to trigger the slide-in campaign. 
  * **Scroll Depth** —Defines the percentage of the targeted page that a user must scroll to trigger the slide-in campaign. 
  * **Inactivity** —Defines the number of seconds that a user must be inactive on the targeted page to trigger the slide-in campaign. Inactivity includes lack of actions that indicate engagement, such as mouse movement and scrolling, and is tracked whether the page is in the foreground or background.

**Header** | This text is the main headline for the campaign.  
**Subheader** | This text is smaller and located beneath the header.  
**CTA Text** | This text appears on the prestyled call-to-action button within the slide-in message.  
**CTA Destination URL** | This URL is the page where users land when they click the call-to-action button.

goals, you can create a confusing experience for your users.
