# Activity Reports

Activity Reports show a variety of metrics that are tracked on your site. You
see a real-time list of recent visitors, the path that they took, and their
actions while visiting.

  * **[Recent Visitors Report](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_report_activity_recent_visitors.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
The Recent Visitors report shows the visitors who came to your site since the
beacon was activated, updated in real time.

  * **[Event Stream Report](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_report_activity_event_stream.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
View the Event Stream report to see a queue of all the events that occur
within your dataset in real-time, automatically refreshed every 15 seconds.
You can add filters for UserID, Company, and Event Type. And you can filter
for a channel audience member, referred to as a user in Personalization.

  * **[Cohorts Report](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_report_activity_cohort.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Cohorts help you visualize the way your site visitors flow from one activity
or status to another over an extended period. You see how the prevalence of
certain goal activities changes over time so you can examine the net
effectiveness of multiple campaigns pushing toward the same goal. You can also
monitor how the general traffic to certain page groups changes to detect
migrations away from or towards certain parts of your site.

  * **[Actions Report](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_report_activity_action.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Use the Actions report to see activity tracked by Personalization, organized
by the actions tracked in the dataset.

  * **[Modules Report](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_report_activity_module.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Group actions using the Modules report to see aggregate stats across the
group. You can add actions to more than one module.

  * **[Paths Report](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_report_activity_path.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
See how visitors navigate your site using the Paths report, so you can better
target your communications and content strategy.

  * **[Funnels Report](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_report_activity_funnel.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Use the Funnels report to view the stages or steps your visitors take, and the
order in which they take them, based on a series of actions. When you
configure a funnel, you select and order the actions that a user takes to move
through the funnel.

  * **[Day and Time Report](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_report_activity_day_time.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Visually analyze trends or traffic spikes using the Day and Time report. This
report provides view options for total visitor count, average length of visit
time, total revenue, average revenue across each visit, and the bounce rate.
Each dot on the graph represents an hour in a day.

  * **[Engagement Score](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_engagement_score.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
The engagement score is an index that tracks how engaged your application
users and site visitors are. The score is based on different factors—visit
information, actions, key performance indicators (KPIs), and segments—during
the defined business cycle.
