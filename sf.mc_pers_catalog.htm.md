# Catalogs

Use catalogs for campaigns, promotions, recommendations, segmentation,
reporting, and other key functions.

  * **[About Catalogs](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_catalog_about.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Learn about catalog objects and catalog items.

  * **[Catalog Objects](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_catalog_object.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Catalog objects and their relationships define the structure of your catalog.
Personalization uses catalog objects to interpret and understand customer
engagement and affinities. Examples of catalog objects include products,
articles, blog posts, categories, brands, styles, and features.
Personalization includes several built-in catalog objects, and you can create
custom ones to meet your specific needs.

  * **[Catalog Localization](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_catalog_localization.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
The Personalization user interface is available only in English. However, you
can localize parts of the Marketing Cloud Personalization platform.
Localization isnâ€™t supported for the Personalization Platform UI, Mobile SDK,
or Open Time Email.

  * **[Create a Static List](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_catalog_static_list_create.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Use the StaticList tag to group products together in a static list. You can
upload a comma-separated values (CSV) file of products to a static list, and
then use that list in Einstein Recipes as an exclusion, inclusion, or booster.

  * **[Static Relationships](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_catalog_profile_static_relationship.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Use static relationships as ingredients in Einstein Recipes to help determine
which additional related products to recommend to your customers.

  * **[Define a SmartBundle Relationship](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_einstein_recipe_smartbundle_relationship_define.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Define SmartBundle relationships to associate categories with one another in
your catalog. You can use SmartBundle relationships as ingredients in Einstein
Recipes to recommend additional items to your customers. The SmartBundle
ingredient considers items from SmartBundle-related categories that customers
bought together in the same cart.
