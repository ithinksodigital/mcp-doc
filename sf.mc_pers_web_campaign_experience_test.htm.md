# Test a Campaign Experience

Although you can see your web campaign render as you create it, you can also
test each campaign experience to see how it will appear to your intended
audience. Testing the campaign experience allows you to view it, regardless of
the qualification rules at the experience or campaign level. With campaign
experience testing, you can review how the experience looks on the page.
