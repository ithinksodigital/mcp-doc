# Consider Personalization Use Cases

Browse the Use Case Library to look for ideas and inspiration for your own
personalization solutions. The use cases represent popular example. But
they’re not templates, nor do they encompass the full range of possible use
cases for your business. Before you commit to implementing one or more
personalization use cases, determine whether the use case aligns with your
business goals, priorities, and other suitability criteria.

## Align Use Cases with Your Business Goals and Priorities

Proper due diligence is a critical prerequisite to the success of any
personalization solution. Before evaluating candidate use cases, start by
answering a series of questions.

  * What are the key goals of your business?
  * What are the areas of focus for my team specifically this year?
  * How can personalization support achieving those goals? 

## Criteria to Evaluate Use Cases

After you've clarified business alignment and priorities, consider three
critical areas:

  * Resource Requirements. What’s the likely level of effort required to bring that use case to market? Does it require a developer resource? Are there changes to your current configuration that the use case can possibly require?
  * Business Value. What’s the projected impact of the use case for your business? Be sure to conduct an ROI analysis to determine whether implementing the use case is worth the investment.
  * Measure Results. How can you ensure that the use case results can be effectively tracked and measured?

Personalization solutions often implement multiple use cases, including use
cases not described in this library.

## Plan to Deploy a Successful Personalization Solution

Your success depends on how well a given use case supports the direction of
your business and the stated objectives of your specific team. After you’ve
determined suitability, you can proceed to adapt the use case to your
particular requirements. For additional information, see [_Video_ : Planning

## Lifecycle Commitment

Your implementation plan must address all stages of the customer lifecycle,
including medium-term and long-term. Solution deployment is an ongoing
commitment. You’re responsible for continuously reviewing in-flight campaigns
to make sure they’re still performing as you expect.

Apply the validation steps we recommend. Your solution succeeds when you're
meeting the needs of your business, but also the needs of your
customers—regardless of where your customers exist within their lifecycle with
your brand.
