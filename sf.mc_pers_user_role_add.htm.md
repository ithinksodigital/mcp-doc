# Add a User Role

Use a default role that you can modify, or create roles with permissions that
meet your security requirements and business needs. Because roles are dataset-
specific, Personalization users can have different roles in different
datasets. Although a role is dataset-specific, when you add a role, itâ€™s
available to select in all datasets.
