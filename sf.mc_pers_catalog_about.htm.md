# About Catalogs

Learn about catalog objects and catalog items.

## Catalog Objects

Catalog objects are the types of items that your customers can engage with,
such as products you sell or articles you want people to read. Catalog objects
have associated attributes that provide context within the overall catalog.
And you can relate catalog objects to other catalog objects to provide a more
granular structure for your catalog. The more detailed your catalog, the
better insight you have into customer engagement and affinities.

## Catalog Items

Generally, you set up your catalog, catalog objects, items, and relationships
during implementation using the site map or an ETL feed. However, you can add,
edit, and archive items for your catalog objects directly in Personalization.
Click **Catalog** in the **Catalog** section of the main navigation, and then
select the desired catalog object name from the list.
