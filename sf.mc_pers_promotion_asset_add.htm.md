# Add Assets to a Promotion

For a promotion to appear in a campaign, it must have an associated asset,
such as an uploaded image or a URL that points to an external image.

### Required User Permissions

Permissions Needed  
---  
To add assets: | A role with Catalog Create/Edit permissions  
  
  1. In the Catalog section of the main navigation, click **Promotions**.
  2. Select a promotion, and click **Edit**.
  3. On the Assets tab, click **Add Asset**.
  4. To upload an image, in the Manage Asset window, click **Image Upload** , and select a file or drag the image within the dotted lines of the Edit Media area. 

Images must be a .png, .jpg, .jpeg, or .gif file.

  5. To reference an external image, click **External Image** , and in the Edit Image URL field, enter the URL.
  6. Assign a content zone or tag to the asset.

Content zones and tags determine which promotions are eligible to be displayed
in a campaign. A promotion can have multiple assets, but you can assign an
individual content zone or tag to only one asset. For example, you can assign
the promotion’s Homepage|Hero content zone to Asset A or to Asset B, but you
can’t assign it to both assets.

  7. Save your changes.
