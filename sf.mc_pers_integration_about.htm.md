# About Integrating Personalization with Other Systems

Use standard and custom integrations to pull and push data between Marketing
Cloud Personalization and other systems.

If your organization is like most, you have customer data spread across
multiple different systems. Marketing Cloud Personalization can:

  * pull information from these disparate systems to build rich user profiles that you can use to target your customers and leads with real-time, one-to-one personalization, and
  * pass analytics data to other systems so that you can monitor, evaluate, and use it in reports for your company's internal processes.

Integration options include:

Type of Integration | Description  
---|---  
standard  | Configure built-in integrations to connect with your existing marketing and sales systems and share data, such as user and campaign details, from field to segment to campaign data.   
custom | Personalization can also share information with most other data sources using robust and flexible APIs. For example, an API can import in-store transactional data to provide each customer's complete purchase history when delivering personalized recommendations. An API can also send in-depth behavioral data from Personalization to external business intelligence tools and customer support systems to increase their value and accuracy.
