# Reports Dashboard

Gain insights about visitor and campaign activity on your site using the
Reports Dashboard. Depending on your industry or function, the Reports
Dashboard provides different sections. If you track transactions in the
Personalization system, the dashboard shows Total Stats first. If you don’t
track transactions in the Personalization system, Activity appears first. If
your site tracks content views or product purchases, the dashboard shows the
Items section at the bottom.
