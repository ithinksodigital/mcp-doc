## How Integration Works

  * Add a Personalization Activity to a Journey Builder journey, then use it to personalize the experience your users have with your website or mobile app based on recent journey interactions.
  * Journey Builder passes actions, identifiers, and attributes you configure back to Personalization for identity merging, segmentation and targeting, and personalization.

"The Personalization system constantly gathers data about your users, your
catalog, and other systems through channel events, API events, and data feeds
to update segments in real time. Use segments to add users to journeys in
Journey Builder within moments of the data changing as they join segments.

## Example Integrations

The Personalization and Journey Builder integration ties all of your
customers’ experiences together—whether customers are on your website, talking
to your call center, or entering loyalty numbers into your point of sale.
Using Personalization Journey Builder Activity, when your customers open your
mobile app or navigate to your website, they see banners and recommendations.
These banners and recommendations are based on where the customers are in the
journey you created in Journey Builder, such as a Back to School journey.

For example, while on a Back to School journey, a retail customer finishes
purchasing uniforms for a student. Personalization Journey Builder Activity
suggests a backpack that fits the age and color choices of the student.

Meanwhile, another customer on a bank’s Back to School journey signs up for a
student checking account. Personalization Journey Builder Activity suggests a
credit card that’s popular with college students, and helps build a credit
profile.
