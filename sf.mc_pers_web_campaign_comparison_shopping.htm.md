# Comparison Shopping Web Campaigns

Online shoppers have many options available, and savvy shoppers visit several
websites to compare products before making a purchase. Marketing Cloud
Personalization helps you target these comparison shoppers to help boost your
conversion rates and reduce your bounce rates.

Comparison shopping describes the action of a user highlighting the name of a
product and copying it to their clipboard. Marketing Cloud Personalization
uses this action to identify users that copy a product name to then search for
a better deal on that product.

Because Personalization can track this behavior, you can build action-based
segments for campaign targeting and analysis, and trigger real-time
experiences to encourage customers to shop with you. You can create a call-out
message about the benefits of purchasing directly, a popup with a special
offer, or any other type of campaign that can potentially prevent the user
from searching elsewhere for the product.

If you want to create comparison shopping web campaigns, talk with your web
developer about adding this functionality to your sitemap.

## Segmentation

To target users who engage in comparison shopping behavior, you create an
action-based segment that identifies when the user highlights the name of a
product. You can use this segment for analytics or to target cross-channel
campaigns.

## Campaign targeting

Trigger campaigns to appear based on the comparison shopping action of a user
highlighting a product's name. Entice users to shop with you by creating a web
campaign with an action-based targeting criteria.
