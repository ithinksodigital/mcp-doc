# Create a Segment Based on User Location

Create segments for your campaigns to target users based on location, such as
their ZIP codes, cities, regions, countries, and ISPs. If you have B2B Detect,
you can use location-based segments to target visitors from specific companies
and industries. Location-based segments are also helpful in understanding the
data that the Personalization system captures about your site.
