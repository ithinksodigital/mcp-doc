# Catalog Objects

Catalog objects and their relationships define the structure of your catalog.
Personalization uses catalog objects to interpret and understand customer
engagement and affinities. Examples of catalog objects include products,
articles, blog posts, categories, brands, styles, and features.
Personalization includes several built-in catalog objects, and you can create
custom ones to meet your specific needs.

  * **[Built-In Catalog Objects](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_catalog_object_built_in.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Built-in catalog objects enable you to quickly begin building your catalog and
define its structure. Personalization uses catalog objects to interpret and
understand customer engagement and affinities. Personalization collects
behavioral data about your customers in the context of your catalog. Catalog
objects can be standalone entities, or they can relate to one another to
provide a more granular structure for your catalog.

  * **[Cardinality and Category Hierarchy](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_catalog_object_cardinality_category_hierarchy.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
With Marketing Cloud Personalization, you can build category hierarchy using
either the Category ETL or the Sitemap/Event API. Before building your
category hierarchy, choose how you want to configure category cardinality.
Then choose which build approach best suits your business needs.

  * **[Create a Custom Catalog Object](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_catalog_object_custom.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Personalization collects behavioral data in the context of the catalog that
you create and uses catalog objects to assess and analyze customer engagement
and affinities. You can add more detail to your catalog by using custom
objects. The more detailed you make your catalog, the more granular your
insights are regarding customer engagement and affinity.

  * **[Customizing the Affinities Graph](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_catalog_object_affinities_graph.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
The Affinities graph displays affinities for objects that use a specific
catalog object type as their Name value. You can define custom catalog objects
to appear in the Affinities graph when viewing a unified customer profile.

  * **[Strict Catalog Security](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_catalog_strict_security.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
When adding or updating catalog objects, use the Strict Catalog Security
setting to determine how Personalization adds new items to your catalog, and
how it updates an itemâ€™s information. When you enable the Strict Catalog
Security setting, Personalization ignores catalog item metadata, such as
attributes, unless it comes from a feed or an authenticated event source.

  * **[Catalog Object Limits](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_catalog_object_limits.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Marketing Cloud Personalization imposes limits per dataset for catalog objects
and attributes.
