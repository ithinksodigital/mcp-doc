# Use Cohorts Reports

Use Cohorts reports to visualize the way your site visitors flow from one
activity or status to another over an extended period.

You can see how the prevalence of certain goal activities changes over time,
so you can examine the net effectiveness of multiple campaigns pushing toward
the same goal. You can also monitor how the general traffic to certain page
groups changes to detect migrations away from or towards certain parts of your
site.

The cohort report includes four areas that you can analyze:

Area | Description  
---|---  
Time period | Set the time period by clicking the date range field. You can choose from these default options: today, past week, past month, and past quarter. Or you can create your own custom date range.  
Customer type | The default customer type is users, which are individual visitors. If you have accounts configured for your dataset, you can group visitors by account on the Cohort report.  
Time grouping | The default time grouping is by week, but you can select by day or month to expand or consolidate the report. For example, if you want to see granular data for each day during the set time period, select day as the time grouping. If you want a higher-level view for the set time period, select week or month.  
Activity | There are three activity types: 

  * First visit—Activities from the user’s first visit to your site.
  * First time doing action—A configured action. 
  * First time having status—You can select a status and then select an action that users with this status complete repeatedly. 

Suppose you want to see the prevalence of free users who repeatedly contacted
support over a given time period. Select Free as the status, and then select
Contact Support as the action.
