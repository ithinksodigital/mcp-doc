# Unified Customer Profile

The Unified Customer Profile provides a comprehensive view of each of your
users—visitors, customers, prospects, and subscribers—based on their
interactions with your various channels.

The Unified Customer Profile provides an overview of all information that
Personalization collects about a particular user—or account if your
organization also markets to businesses. If you market to businesses, the
Unified Account Profile displays aggregate information for the account. The
information that displays depends on the type of business you
select—ecommerce, demand generation, or SaaS.

  * **[View a Unified Customer Profile](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_unified_customer_profile_view.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
The Unified Customer Profile provides an overview of all information that
Personalization collects about a particular user. The information that you see
depends on the type of business your administrator selects for your
dataset—ecommerce, demand generation, or SaaS.

  * **[Identify User Segment Membership](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_segment_user_membership.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Identifying which segments a user belongs to. This information can help
troubleshoot certain problems, for example, when a user isn’t receiving a
certain message, or isn’t qualifying for a specific campaign.

  * **[Bulk Delete Profiles By Segment](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_segment_user_bulk_delete.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Permanently delete all profiles in a selected segment from Marketing Cloud
Personalization. Bulk deletion reduces the number of named profiles in the
system.

  * **[Create a User Profile Attribute](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_user_profile_attributes_create.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
User profile attributes can collect data you can use in segmentation,
reporting, or with integrated third-party systems. For example, if you create
a form in Personalization, you can assign each field to an existing attribute.
Depending on the configuration of your dataset, the attributes can either
collect the data for reporting, or can write it to a third-party integrated
system.

  * **[Attribute Update Logic](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_profile_attribute_update.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
You can use multiple sources to update attributes. Attributes retain values
from authenticated sources such as ETL or Channel: Server (/authevent API)
over lower priority sources, such as the web.

  * **[Management of Sensitive User Information](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_user_information_manage_sensitive.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Personalization uses the JavaScript Beacon to collect behavioral information
for users of your digital properties and provide them with personalized
experiences based on those behaviors. The JavaScript Beacon collects the data
through a user’s browser, encrypts it using SSL, and transfers it to the
Personalization servers. Personalization doesn’t store sensitive data, such as
credit card numbers and some personally identifiable information. You can
decide which sensitive data to collect. Personalization stores non-personally
identifiable and nonsensitive data in its cloud service.
