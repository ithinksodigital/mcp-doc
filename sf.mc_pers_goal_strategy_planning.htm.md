# Global Goal Strategy and Planning

Create filters for use with reporting and campaign statistics, or use any
default filters. Create global goals (primary objectives) that you want your
visitors to complete.

Global goals are the primary objectives that you want visitors or users to
complete. When thinking about global goals, it’s important to consider your
strategic company goals and any KPIs you’re measuring on your site or in your
business. You can use goals to measure non-revenue conversions or secondary
KPIs in Personalization.

For example, global goals can include completed a purchase, added to cart,
downloaded or viewed content, or completed a form. A visitor or user completes
a global goal when they join the corresponding segment. As a result, users
typically achieve global goals one time. However, in some cases a user can
leave and rejoin a segment, achieving the goal multiple times. Also, because
you can pull offline data into segments, and segments are used to create
global goals, you can also include offline goal metrics.

After you create a global goal, you can view how any campaign is performing
against that goal and other site-wide reporting. Global goals are recorded for
all relevant activity starting from the time they’re created. It’s important
to plan ahead and create them before the activity you want to measure.
