# Visits Reports

The Visits section of Personalization reports shows metrics on visitor
behavior, visitor technologies, and referring sources. Each of the three
reports in the Visits section offer multiple views.

  * **[Behavior Report](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_report_visits_behavior.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Use the Behavior report to view the number of new versus returning visitors
based on visits, engagement, logged-in status, and purchases. You can define
the date range and apply one filter to narrow the results by campaign or by
other criteria.

  * **[Technology Report](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_report_visits_technology.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Use the Technology report to gain insights on the types of browsers and
devices that your visitors use when they view your site. You can define the
date range and apply a filter to narrow the results.

  * **[Referring Sources Report](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_report_visits_referring_sources.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Personalization starts the moment a visitor arrives on your site, so you want
to know how they got there. Use the Referring Sources report to view how
people arrived on your site so that you can customize your messaging for each
visitor.
