# Create a Mobile Push Campaign

Create a Mobile Push campaign to send push notifications to your iOS and
Android app users. For Android users, the campaigns support Firebase Cloud
Messaging (FCM) and require an app integration with the Personalization
Android SDK 1.3 and later. For iOS users, the campaigns support Apple Push
Notification service (APNs) and Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), and require an
app integration with Personalization iOS SDK 1.3 and later.

Before you publish a Mobile Push campaign, you must generate and upload a
certificate for Apple Push Notification service (APNs) or Firebase Cloud
Messaging (FCM). If you enter credentials for both APNs and FCM, you must pick
one when you add the app to a Mobile Push campaign. To prevent duplicate
notifications, Personalization only sends to one platform.

  * **[Add a Mobile Push Frequency](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_mobile_campaign_push_frequency.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
To prevent spamming a mobile app user with excessive alerts from a Mobile Push
campaign, you can limit the number of notifications a user can receive within
a certain time frame.
