### Required Editions

Available in: Premium Edition  
---  
  
**Question Type** |  **Description** |  **Best for...**  
---|---|---  
Single Input | Designed for a single line of free-form text. | Youâ€™re looking for a simple answer because it would be difficult for respondents to view long responses before submitting them.  
Checkbox | Gives the respondent the option to select one or more answers from a list. Multiple answers are stored as an array in the user profile. | You want to give respondents the flexibility to select more than one response.  
Radiogroup | Provides a list of items to select from, but the respondent can choose only one answer. | You want only one response to a particular question.  
Dropdown | Similar to a radiogroup in that respondents can select only one option but takes up less visual space. | You have a long list of items but limited real estate.  
Comment | Respondents can enter free-form text responses with no character limit. | You want respondents to have the flexibility to provide a long answer to a question.  
Rating | Respondents assign a rating to a question. You can design an appropriate scale for the question, with the answer options appearing along a horizontal line. | Although you can add as many choices as you like, from a usability perspective, this question type is best when there are limited options.  
HTML | Use the HTML question type to add video, audio, images, or create a custom look with HTML code. | You have access to a developer and must create a custom question format or include creative assets.
