# Event Types

Personalization captures user activity as events. Depending on your dataset’s
configuration, you see various event types.

You can view events in several ways including on the live event stream and on
a customer or account profile. You can export events so you can bring them
into another system for analysis.

Event types depend on your dataset’s configuration and can include:

  * Named page views, which are defined by your Personalization Implementation

  * Actions from action data captured in Personalization

  * Personalization campaign activity

  * Catalog interactions

  * Data capture errors
