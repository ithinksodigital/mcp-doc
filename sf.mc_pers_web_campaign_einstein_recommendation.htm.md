Use Einstein Recipes to create web campaigns that recommend your products,
blogs, articles, or other content from your catalog. Use the built-in global
template or a custom template that a developer creates.

## About Einstein Recommendations Web Campaigns

  * An Einstein recommendations web template can recommend a single item type from your catalog, such as products, blogs, or articles. Available recipes align with that item type.
  * An Einstein recommendations web template can return up to 12 recommended items. Your developer can modify your template to return fewer items.
  * When using multiple experiences to either A/B test different recipe configurations or to show different recipes to different users (rule-based campaign), you must add the template to each experience.

## Einstein Recommendations Web Templates

The Einstein recommendations web templates available to you can differ in name
and configuration options due to modifications by your developer. If you need
additional styling or configuration options, ask your template developer about
modifying the template.
