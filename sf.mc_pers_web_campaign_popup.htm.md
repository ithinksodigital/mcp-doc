# Popup Web Campaigns

Popup web campaigns are useful for preventing cart or browse abandonment or
for capturing email addresses. You can test different text, imagery, and
calls-to-action to determine which one is best at grabbing the attention of
your users.

## Recommendations for Using Popups

Popup web campaigns appear unexpectedly on a user’s screen based on the user’s
behavior, which can be effective, but intrusive, so use them sparingly. These
campaigns generally include a message, an image, and a call-to-action option,
such as a button or an input field. They typically target a global content
zone and appear on all pages of your website. If you only want your popup to
appear on certain pages, make sure you include page targeting logic at the
campaign level to restrict where the popup can appear.

## Popup Web Templates

You can use one of the pre-built global templates (Exit Intent or Exit Intent
with EmailCapture) in your dataset to create popup web campaigns.

Note

The templates available to you can have different name and configuration
options if your developer modified them. If you need additional styling or
configuration options, ask your template developer about creating a custom
template or modifying an existing template. For example, you can have a popup
message respond to a triggering event rather than exit intent behavior.

**Exit Intent Popup** — Select this template to show a popup message when a
user displays behavior consistent with the intent to exit your website.

Template Option | Description  
---|---  
**Lightbox** | This option makes the popup an overlay on the page so the user can’t interact with other content.  
**Background Image URL** | This option lets you add the URL for a hosted image. Locate the image, click to open it in a browser window, and copy the URL to enter it in the field.   
**Style** | This template offers the options of **Dark on Light** (dark text on a light image) and **Light on Dark** (light text on a dark image) for flexibility in displaying in the background image.  
**Header** | This text is the main headline for the campaign.  
**Subheader** | This text is smaller and located beneath the header.  
**CTA Text** | This text appears on the pre-styled call-to-action button within the popup message.  
**CTA Destination URL** | This URL is the page where users land when they click the call-to-action button.

Note Make sure to carefully consider your landing page destination. If the
landing page doesn't align with your targeting logic or campaign goals, you
can create a confusing experience for your users.

**Exit Intent Popup with Email Capture** — Select this template to show a
popup message with a field to capture the user's email address when they
display behavior consistent with the intent to exit your website.

Template Option | Description  
---|---  
**Lightbox** | This option makes the popup an overlay on the page so the user can’t interact with other content.  
**Background Image URL** | This option lets you add the URL for a hosted image. Locate the image, click to open it in a browser window, and copy the URL to enter it in the field. Ensure that the URL doesn’t change. If the URL changes or if you delete the image, the campaign doesn’t display correctly.  
**Style** | This template offers the options of **Dark on Light** (dark text on a light image) and **Light on Dark** (light text on a dark image) for flexibility in displaying in the background image.  
**Header** | This text is the main headline for the campaign.  
**Subheader** | This text is smaller and located beneath the header.  
**Subheader Visibility** | This option determines whether the subheader displays.  
**CTA Text** | This text appears on the pre-styled call-to-action button within the popup message.  
**Opt-Out Text** | This text appears on a button the user can click to close the message and opt out of providing an email address.  
**Confirmation Screen Header** | This text appears after a user successfully submits an email address.  
**Confirmation Screen Subheader** | This text appears below the confirmation header after a user successfully submits an email address.  
**Subheader Visibility** | This option determines whether the confirmation subheader displays.

Note When using this template in a web campaign, make sure that you target
users that don’t have a value associated with the emailAddress attribute in
their Unified Customer Profile.
