# Set Up the Visual Editor

Learn how to set up the Visual Editor.

  * **[Install the Salesforce Interactions SDK Launcher](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_web_campaign_interactions_sdk_launcher.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Install the Salesforce Interactions SDK Launcher, a Google Chrome browser
extension, which includes the Visual Editor. You use the Visual Editor to add
personalization features to your website. Using web campaign templates, you
can create personalization campaigns targeted to specific groups, individual
users, or events.

  * **[Replace the SDK URL Locally](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_web_campaign_interactions_sdk_launcher_force_SDK_URL.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
If the Server-Side JavaScript beacon is already present on your site, you can
change the dataset used on the site in your local browser with the Force SDK
URL option. This option is useful if you want to work on a different dataset,
for example, to maintain a development or testing dataset and a live
production dataset.

  * **[Access the Visual Editor Without the Salesforce Interactions SDK Launcher](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_web_campaign_visual_editor_no_launcher.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
If your organization doesn’t allow you to download and install Chrome
extensions, you can access the Visual Editor by launching it from within
Marketing Cloud Personalization.

  * **[Add Domains to the Visual Editor Allowlist](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_web_campaign_visual_editor_allowlist.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
You can use the Visual Editor only with website domains that you include on
the Allowed Domains list. If you don’t list your domains on the allowlist, you
can’t log in to the Visual Editor.
