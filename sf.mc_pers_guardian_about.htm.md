# About Guardian

Guardian continuously monitors thousands of metrics that it gathers from your
site, web application, or mobile app. It uses these metrics to discover
current trends, identify potential issues, and surface optimization
opportunities. Guardian is part of Personalization, so there’s nothing to set
up or configure for it to recognize what's important to your business.

Using predefined behaviors, each with its own series of metrics, Guardian
predicts impact across your digital property. The tool can then proactively
suggest ways to improve engagement when metrics fall outside of a predicted
range.

## Guardian Terminology

To better understand Guardian, become familiar with these common terms:

Term | Description  
---|---  
Global | Global topics and signals impact your entire digital property and aren’t restricted to a specific segment or campaign.  
Topic | A subset of dataset activity that uses topic-focused metrics to predict positive or negative impact on your digital property. Topics are things like campaigns, visitor groups, global goals, and device types. Topics are predefined in Guardian and don’t require customization.   
Metrics | Metrics are measures that are tracked within topics. The Global topic contains all possible metric types. All other topics contain a subset of the metric types available in the Global topic. For example, a campaign has clickthroughs, a clickthrough rate, revenue, and average order value. Mobile visits have only visit count and visit duration.  
Signal | A Signal occurs when data points exceed or fall below an expected range. Signals can have a 'Positive' or 'Negative' impact depending on the metric.  
Red | Indicates something that needs attention. Anything with a red indicator means that the prediction is having a negative impact on engagement.  
Green | Indicates something that has a positive impact. Anything with a green indicator means that the prediction is having a positive impact on engagement.  
Digital property | The application, website, or mobile app associated with a dataset.  
Seasonality | Guardian considers all data accumulated since the JavaScript Beacon was installed. However, Guardian prioritizes visitor behavior and site performance from the same day and time last week and last month when making predictions and listing signals.  
  
## Guardian Organization and Metrics

Guardian is organized in topics. Each topic contains several metrics that are
specific to that topic. Depending on what Guardian detects for your site, you
see one or more signals within each metric. If Guardian doesn’t detect
positive or negative activity for a particular metric, there aren’t any
signals.
