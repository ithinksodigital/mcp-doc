# Add Question Visibility Conditions

All survey questions are visible to all visitors who qualify to see the survey
campaign. You can use the visibility setting to make a question invisible or
apply visibility conditions. Visibility conditions always take priority over
the visibility setting. With visibility conditions, you can make questions
appear only if respondents answer in a certain way. For example, only show a
follow-up question if the respondent gave a specific answer to the initial
question.
