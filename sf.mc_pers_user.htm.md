# Access Management

Administrators control user and Salesforce employee access to Personalization.
Access to Personalization starts within Marketing Cloud, but administrators
manage user roles and permissions in Personalization. Administrators also
manage user data changes, SFTP users and files, and two-factor authentication.

  * **[Create an SFTP Account](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_sftp_account_create.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Send and receive data from an automated platform safely and securely using ETL
Integration. After you create an SFTP account, add the credentials to your FTP
client.

  * **[View ETL Files on the SFTP Site](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_etl_files_view_on_sftp_site.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Review processed ETL files after creating SFTP accounts and beginning data
transfer. Personalization deletes files after 60 days.

  * **[Configure an SFTP IP Allowlist](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_sftp_ip_allowlist_config.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Use SFTP IP allow lists to improve system security. Using allowlists to
identify individual IP addresses or ranges of IP addresses that belong to your
network, Personalization can prevent bad actors from gaining SFTP access. If
you don’t create an allowlist, or your allowlist is empty, Personalization
accepts SFTP connections from any IP address.

  * **[User Data Changes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_user_data_changes.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Change or delete stored data associated with every visitor, customer, or user
based on their interactions across channels. You can change or delete data
from the Personalization interface, or using an API call.

  * **[Personalization Access for Salesforce Customer Support](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_access_salesforce_setup.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Before a support team or success manager can access your account, an
administrator must grant access. Salesforce provides the strictest access
controls to customer data.

  * **[Management of Sensitive User Information](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_user_information_manage_sensitive.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Personalization uses the JavaScript Beacon to collect behavioral information
for users of your digital properties and provide them with personalized
experiences based on those behaviors. The JavaScript Beacon collects the data
through a user’s browser, encrypts it using SSL, and transfers it to the
Personalization servers. Personalization doesn’t store sensitive data, such as
credit card numbers and some personally identifiable information. You can
decide which sensitive data to collect. Personalization stores non-personally
identifiable and nonsensitive data in its cloud service.

  * **[Create a User Profile Attribute](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_user_profile_attributes_create.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
User profile attributes can collect data you can use in segmentation,
reporting, or with integrated third-party systems. For example, if you create
a form in Personalization, you can assign each field to an existing attribute.
Depending on the configuration of your dataset, the attributes can either
collect the data for reporting, or can write it to a third-party integrated
system.
