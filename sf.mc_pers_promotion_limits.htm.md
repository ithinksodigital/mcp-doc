When creating a promotion, the only required information is the name and the URL of the landing page. For a promotion to return in a campaign, you must have an asset associated with the promotion. Adding eligibility criteria, promotion attributes, and related catalog objects is recommended. A promotion attribute determines which promotions appear in a campaign. Personalization uses related catalog objects to track and measure customer affinities across item types in your catalog.")
