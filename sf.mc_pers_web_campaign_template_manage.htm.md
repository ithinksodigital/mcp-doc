You create web campaigns using a web campaign template that a developer
creates. Templates offer flexibility to developers who can create a campaign
framework to achieve specific business goals. Preconfigured templates make it
easy for you to get started with Marketing Cloud Personalization templates.
Using a well-planned template, any member of your team can create, test, and
publish a web campaign.
