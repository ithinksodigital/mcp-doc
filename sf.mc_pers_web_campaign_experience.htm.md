# Web Campaign Experiences

A web campaign experience is the _experience_ an individual customer has with
a particular web personalization or activation campaign. You can use
experiences to create different personalization results within the same
campaign.

## Determine the Number of Experiences for a Web Campaign

Determine how many experiences you want to have for your web campaign. If you
want to deliver a different campaign experience to various groups of qualified
users, create additional experiences by cloning the original configured
experience. Then you can modify the other experiences using the same template,
or apply a different template.

## Name the Experience

The name of each experience shows up in your campaign statistics report. It
can be helpful to use a descriptive name for each experience so you can more
effectively interpret the report results.

## How Experiences Are Prioritized in Rule-Based Campaigns

For rule-based campaigns, if a user qualifies for a campaign and qualifies for
multiple experiences, the experience at the top of the list has the highest
priority. You can reorder campaign experiences in the campaign editor.

## Provide Separate Experiences

You can create a campaign for first-time users of your website that shows
different copy and images to users from different geographic regions or
different industries. Using one campaign, you can create separate experiences,
each targeting a different subset of your website users. Then you use rules to
control the visibility of each experience.
