# Cohorts Report

Cohorts help you visualize the way your site visitors flow from one activity
or status to another over an extended period. You see how the prevalence of
certain goal activities changes over time so you can examine the net
effectiveness of multiple campaigns pushing toward the same goal. You can also
monitor how the general traffic to certain page groups changes to detect
migrations away from or towards certain parts of your site.
