# March 2021 Features in Interaction Studio

The following functionality was released in March, 2021.

## Server-Side Templates and Campaigns

Interaction Studio provides clients with the ability to configure testing and
personalization at the server-to-server level. As of the most recent
Interaction Studio release, the server-side campaign system can leverage a
campaigns and templates system that mirrors the configuration process for
Interaction Studio web campaigns. Key components of the release included:

  * An in-app template builder interface for developers to construct Server-Side templates (in-app template editor also added for web templates)
  * An enhanced in-app Server-Side campaign configuration screen for business users to apply the server-side templates
  * A new application rule for business users to target certain experiences to multiple applications within a single campaign (e.g. POS, CRM, Mobile)

Business users can now collaborate with their development team to easily
configure a single campaign that extends across multiple touch-points.
Business user documentation on campaign building is [Server-Side
Campaigns](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_server_side_campaign.htm&language=en_US&type=5
"Server-side campaigns integrate testing and personalization at the server-to-
server level. While Marketing Cloud Personalization handles the campaign
logic, you need a developer to write the code to call the appropriate APIs and
provide information about the website visitor.") and developer documentation
is available on the Interaction Studio [developer
documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/marketing/personalization/guide/server-
side-campaigns-templates.html) site.
