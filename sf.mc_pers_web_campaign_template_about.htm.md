# About Templates for Web Campaigns

You create web campaigns using a web campaign template that a developer
creates. Templates offer flexibility to developers who can create a campaign
framework to achieve specific business goals. Preconfigured templates make it
easy for you to get started with Marketing Cloud Personalization templates.
Using a well-planned template, any member of your team can create, test, and
publish a web campaign.

## Developer Collaboration

Web campaigns render a template into an input form so you can make simple
modifications and then use rules to target specific audiences. After you
finalize the business goal for a campaign, the audience, and the general
approach you want to take, you can work with a developer to:

  * Decide which parts of the template a campaign creator can configure.
  * Ensure template options meet the needs of your marketing team for the specific campaign, such as limiting color options to your brand color palette.
  * Add helper text in subtitles that provide visual cues to the campaign creator about what they can configure and the best way to do so.

## Web Template Framework

Web templates provide a framework that you use to create personalization
campaigns. Templates define what a campaign can render, such as promotional
assets, product recommendations, copy, and images. Templates also define what
you can edit, such as the recipes that power the recommendations, message
copy, and the call-to-action copy. For example, a developer can define a
template for a recommendations bar on a product detail page (PDP) so you can
add the title and the recipe for the recommendations. Or, a developer can
create an email capture template so you can enter the header and subheader
text, along with various call-to-action options to test.

## Common Template Types

Common template types include:

Type | Description  
---|---  
Popup messages | You can use popup campaigns in many ways, from cart abandonment to email capture. Popup messages typically include copy, an image, and a call-to-action option, such as a button or an input field. These messages pop up on a user’s screen, which can be effective, but intrusive, so use them sparingly.  
Infobar messages | These messages are designed to capture a user’s attention. Infobars appear at the top or bottom of a page. Like popup messages, they’re attention grabbers, but typically have limited real estate and are most often used to communicate important temporary information.  
Inline messages | This message format seamlessly adds content within the existing structure of your page. Inline messages are often used for product or content recommendation campaigns. For example, you can customize the homepage hero for users from different geographic regions or industries, based on affinities and preferences.  
Callout messages | This message type draws attention to a particular area or feature on the page. Callout messages appear above, below, to the right, or to the left of the item you want to draw attention to and have an arrow point to it.
