# Manage Access and User Data

Administrators control user and Salesforce employee access to Personalization.
Access to Personalization starts within Marketing Cloud, but administrators
manage user roles and permissions in Personalization. Administrators also
manage user data changes, SFTP users and files, and two-factor authentication.

  * **[Personalization Permissions in Marketing Cloud Engagement](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_setup_marketing_cloud_permissions.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
You can open Personalization directly from Marketing Cloud Engagement after an
administrator sets up access.

  * **[User Roles and Dataset Permissions](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_setup_user_roles_dataset_permissions.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Personalization includes default roles that you can assign to users. Because
roles are specific to a dataset, you can assign access to users only at the
level they need. You can also create custom roles to grant particular
permissions.

  * **[Edit a User Account](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_user_account_edit.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Change account details like the user email address, first name, last name, and
role. After the account is created, you can’t change the username.

  * **[Modify User Account Access](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_user_account_access_modify.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Though you can’t delete a user from Marketing Cloud Personalization after
their account is created, you can refine user access to Marketing Cloud
Personalization at any time. By disabling account administrator permissions
and removing any roles for individual datasets, you can effectively remove
access to the Marketing Cloud Personalization app for that user.
