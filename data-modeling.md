# Data Modeling

Data modeling in Marketing Cloud Personalization involves the configuration of
the platform to represent the key business information for your company. Data
in Personalization represents three primary areas of key information: user
behaviors, tracked at the user, account, business, or household level; shadow
catalog information, representing key business objects; and statistical
tracking of key performance indicators, such as purchase revenue.

The configuration of these features is accomplished in the Personalization
platform by administrators during initial setup.
