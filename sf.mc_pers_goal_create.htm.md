# Create a Goal

Global goals are the primary actions that you want visitors or users to
complete on your website, SaaS app, or mobile app. Because global goals are
created from segments, you must first create a segment defined with the
criteria that you want to use for the global goal. Any global goal can also be
used as a filter.
