# View and Edit External Campaigns

After you create an external campaign for a third-party product integration,
external campaigns appear in the Uncategorized folder as users begin arriving
at a landing page. The external campaigns have click-throughs, but not
impressions because Personalization doesnâ€™t track impressions for external
campaigns. Only the first event of a visit counts toward third-party campaign
attribution.
