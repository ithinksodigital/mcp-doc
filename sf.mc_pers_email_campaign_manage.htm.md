# Manage Open Time Email Campaigns

Create and configure an open time email campaign.

  * **[Create an Open Time Email Campaign](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_email_campaign_create.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Generate a block of HTML code for an Open Time Email campaign and use it in
your existing email marketing service to add personalized content for each
recipient. After creating an Open Time Email campaign, you can clone it and
reuse it with the same recipe for additional campaigns. You can also add
exclusions and inclusions to your campaigns to tailor them to your overall
email strategy.

  * **[Use Promotions in Email Campaigns](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_email_campaign_promotion.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Tailor email campaign experiences for each recipient using promotions, without
using different copy or separate recipient segments. For each promotion, you
can view detailed statistics, so you know what's working and can adjust what
isn't. After you create a promotion, you can add it to an Open Time Email
campaign. You can use the same promotion across multiple campaigns and
experiences. For example, in one campaign, you can create a different
experience for tablet, phone, and desktop users.

  * **[Create HTML Code for Your Email Campaign](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_email_campaign_html_code.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Generate HTML code that you can use to deliver personalized recommendations to
campaign recipients. After generating the HTML code, insert it into the Open
Time Email campaign in your email marketing service.

  * **[Capture Open Time Email Campaign URLs](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_email_campaign_url.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Use URLs from Open Time Email campaigns to import item images or link to
catalog items in externally-managed email campaigns. For some email marketing
services, you can use only the URLs from your Open Time Email campaign, and
not the entire HTML code block generated using Personalization.
