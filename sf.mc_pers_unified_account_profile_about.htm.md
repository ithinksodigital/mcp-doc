Learn about the Unified Account Profile.

## Build and Enrich Account Profiles

Personalization builds account profiles through a reverse IP lookup and
enriches them with firmographic data, such as industry, revenue, and employee
count, using the B2B Detect feature. You can integrate with your key data
sources to improve these profiles based on cross-channel engagement.

## Two-level Profile Hierarchy

Personalization supports a two-level profile hierarchy—user-level profiles and
account-level profiles—that it maintains in real time to give you meaningful
insight into corporate-level engagement. Personalization maps account-level
profiles as one-to-many to maintain multiple known and anonymous user profiles
that you access through the single account profile that contains them.
Personalization tracks and aggregates events at an account level while
maintaining granular user-level behavioral tracking.

## View Unified Account Profiles
