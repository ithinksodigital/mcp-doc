# Identity System Setup for Open Time Email

To create unified customer profiles for each of your customers, use
Personalizationâ€™s identity system to configure the identifiers in your Open
Time Email campaigns. To merge user profiles from various sources, you
designate an identity type to use when matching users between your email
service provider and Personalization. You can use only one identity type. If
you send multiple identifiers in an Open Time Email campaign, Personalization
ignores all but the designated identity type.
