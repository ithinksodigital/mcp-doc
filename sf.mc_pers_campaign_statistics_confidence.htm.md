# Confidence Explained in Campaign Statistics

Confidence on the Campaign Statistics screen refers to the term statistical
confidence. It’s a measure of how sure you are of your results from an A/B
test. It isn’t a measure of how effective a campaign was, but a measure of how
certain you can be with the campaign’s displayed impact.

## Bayesian Statistics

The numbers you see in Campaign Statistics are reported based on mathematical
and statistical concepts from Bayesian statistics. The data provided for your
Personalization campaign only has a confidence rating when both the test and
control groups have 35 goal completions.

## Example

A test group is a group of visitors who see a campaign experience they qualify
for. A control group is a group of visitors who don’t see a campaign they
qualify for. Suppose you publish a campaign with 50% of your visitors in the
test group and 50% in the control group. After 2 weeks of running the
campaign, you see these conversion rates each day:

![11789321-5183-4a7b-aa95-e205006074cc]

Conversion rates vary each day. Some days conversions are higher, and other
days conversions are lower.

The test group has a higher conversion rate than the control group. And the
average for the test group is much higher than the average for the control.
Also, control group conversion rates range from a minimum of 0 and a maximum
of 0.5. In contrast, the test group has a minimum of 0.6, so __ it never falls
into the control group’s conversion rate range. Because there’s no crossover
between test and control conversion, there’s high confidence that the test
group has a higher conversion rate than the control group.
