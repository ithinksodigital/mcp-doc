# View Detailed Statistics for Every Triggered Campaign

View detailed graphs and charts to get insight into the effectiveness of every
triggered campaign. For example, you can see information about how the
campaign affected conversions and revenue. Or, you can view revenue and
purchases attributed to a campaign and see details about trigger success and
failure.

To view detailed campaign statistics for a campaign, the campaign must have
recorded campaign impressions.

  1. From the main navigation, in the **Channels & Campaigns** section, select **Triggered** | **Triggered Campaigns**.
  2. Find the campaign and click **Statistics**.
  3. Click **Detailed Statistics**.
  4. Apply filters and options to narrow results. Campaign statistics recalculate after each change.

Option | Description  
---|---  
**Outlier Filtering** | This option is available if outliers are configured in **Catalog and Profile Objects Settings**. Filtering outliers prevents orders that exceed the configured general order range, like bulk orders, from skewing your campaign statistics. So if a customer places an order far above the expected deviance from the average order value, it doesn’t impact your data. You can exclude outliers from campaign statistics by selecting **Settings > Catalog and Profile Objects** from the main navigation. In the **Revenue Tracking** section, select **Filter Outliers** and then enter the maximum values. To exclude outliers in Campaign Statistics, set **Outlier Filtering** to **On**.  
**Results Filter** | To view only the users who meet filter criteria, select an available filter. After you select a filter, campaign statistics recalculate to show the performance of the campaign only for the visitors from the selected filter.  
**Attribution Type** | Select **Triggered** or **Click** as the attribution type.  
**Attribution Window** | Set the period between the visit impression and the conversion or goal completion.  
**Comparison Baseline** | To set the comparison baseline for campaign metrics, select **Experience** or **Control**.  
**Goal Selection** | Measure campaign attribution against the goal you configure in this section.  
**Start and End** | To adjust the time frame of the displayed campaign statistics, change the **Start** and **End** date and time. To jump to months, click the header one time. To jump to years, click the header twice. Dates and times are shown in local time.  
  
  5. View the summary table for an overview of campaign impressions.

Section | Description  
---|---  
**Purchases** | Lists the revenue per user, average order value, conversions, total revenue attributed to the campaign, and total conversions.  
**Activity** | Lists the number of unique visitors and successful triggers.  
**Triggers** | Lists the number of trigger failures. Triggers can fail if there’s a mismatch, such as data types or empty values between the the mandatory Marketing Cloud Engagement data extension and the data Personalization sends. To see additional details about trigger failures, scroll to the **Triggered Failure** detail graph.  
  
  6. View detailed graphs and drill down into each statistic on the summary table. Also, view goals and goal completions based on the goal you selected for the campaign.
