After you publish an open time item template, you can’t change it. We
recommend you finish modifying templates before you publish them. You can
clone an open time item template and modify the clone.

Publishing an open time item template requires generating individual images
for all items in your catalog. This process can take some time.

Marketing Cloud Personalization has limits for the number of open time item
templates that you can publish. For more information, see [Personalization
Limits](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_limits.htm&language=en_US&type=5
"Learn about the limits and capabilities in Marketing Cloud
Personalization.").

  1. In the Channels & Campaigns section of the main navigation, select **Email > Open Time Item Templates**.
  2. Select the unpublished open time item template.
  3. If you want to make changes, click **Edit**. Otherwise, click **Publish**.

The template’s state is “Publishing” while Personalization generates images
for all products in your catalog.

When image generation is complete, Personalization publishes your open time
item template, and it’s ready to use in Open Time Email campaigns.
