configuration and layout changes. After you get the survey looking the way you
want, you can replace the original survey with the cloned and updated one.

  3. Next to the survey that you want to clone, click the double paper icon.

  5. Edit the survey as needed.
  6. To save changes, click **Save** to stay in the survey or **Save and Close** to close the survey.
