Learn about A/B test segments.

Using A/B test segments in your campaigns gives you additional flexibility and
control over how the Personalization system distributes traffic, and which
users see which experiences. Scenarios that work well with A/B test segments
typically involve more than one campaign.

## Example A

Suppose your strategy includes an initial campaign followed by subsequent
campaigns at specific intervals. For example, you’re testing whether
subsequent recommendations campaigns have better lift than the control
experience. You want the same group of users to receive the campaign
experience with recommendations versus the control experience, which doesn’t
have recommendations. Creating a control group segment that always receives
the control experience can help you achieve this test.

## Example B

Suppose you have three campaigns in your test, and each has a control
experience. You want to make sure the same group always gets the control
experience. Creating two groups, one for Global Control and one for Global
Experience, can help achieve that goal. You can also use the Segment Compare
feature to see how the two segments perform against each other for all
campaigns.
