# Modify User Account Access

Though you canâ€™t delete a user from Marketing Cloud Personalization after
their account is created, you can refine user access to Marketing Cloud
Personalization at any time. By disabling account administrator permissions
and removing any roles for individual datasets, you can effectively remove
access to the Marketing Cloud Personalization app for that user.

### Required User Permissions

Permissions Needed  
---  
To remove or alter Personalization permissions for user accounts: | Administrator permissions  
  
  1. From the main navigation, select **Security** | **Manage Users**.
  2. Select the user from the list.

To search for a user, enter the partial ID, name, or email address.

  3. Select **Edit User**.
  4. Deselect account permissions, for example **Account Administrator**.
  5. (Optional) Select or remove any roles for individual datasets.

Roles include Editor With Export, Campaign Approver, Editor, Campaign Author,
and Viewer.

  6. Click **OK**.
