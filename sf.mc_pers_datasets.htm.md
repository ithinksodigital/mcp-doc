# Personalization Datasets

Marketing Cloud Personalization datasets are collections of events, catalog
configurations, and user profiles that keep your Personalization data separate
and organized. Within your Personalization account, you can set up multiple
datasets. Data within one dataset is separate from data in other datasets so
that you can analyze customer engagement differently.

You can export the events in a Personalization dataset to a CSV or JSON file.
Events are the rows that appear in the event stream. Each event can have an
action and several custom fields associated with it. You can use the exported
file to analyze how fields are associated with one another, and to find
statistical trends. You can adjust the time period for the export to get the
specific data you need.
