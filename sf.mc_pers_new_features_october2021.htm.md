# October 2021 Features in Interaction Studio

The following functionality was released in October, 2021.

## Customize the Customer Journey with Interaction Studio Journey Builder
Activity

With Interaction Studio Journey Builder Activity, you can customize the
customer journey using Interaction Studio customer identities, attributes, and
actions. Journey Builder alerts Interaction Studio that a customer is on a
journey. Then, Interaction Studio customizes any digital touch-points that
each customer has with your brand, including your mobile app, website, and
call center. And it connects these interactions to ensure a connected customer
experience.

Where: This change applies to Professional, Corporate, and Enterprise Editions
of Marketing Cloud since the feature is available in Journey Builder.

Who: To use this feature, you must have Interaction Studio User/Account
Profile Create/Edit permissions and Journey Builder Automation Create, Edit
permissions.
