Offer your customers special deals or advertise specific products with
campaign promotions in Marketing Cloud Personalization. A promotion is an
image that encourages customers to click through for more details. You can
deploy promotion images on a web page or in an email, including call-to-action
messages or incentives to engage customers and achieve specific business
goals. You can also use promotions with Einstein Decisions for rule-based
decisions and machine learning to target customers in multiple channels.
