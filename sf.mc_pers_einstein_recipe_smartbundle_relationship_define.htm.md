# Define a SmartBundle Relationship

Define SmartBundle relationships to associate categories with one another in
your catalog. You can use SmartBundle relationships as ingredients in Einstein
Recipes to recommend additional items to your customers. The SmartBundle
ingredient considers items from SmartBundle-related categories that customers
bought together in the same cart.

Note You canâ€™t relate a category to its parent category because they already
have an inherent hierarchical relationship.

Note SmartBundle relationships are bidirectional. So if you add category B as
a SmartBundle relationship to category A, Personalization also adds category A
as a SmartBundle relationship to category B.

  7. Click the **Details** tab.
  8. Save your work.

After you define SmartBundle relationships, you can use them as ingredients in
Einstein Recipes.
