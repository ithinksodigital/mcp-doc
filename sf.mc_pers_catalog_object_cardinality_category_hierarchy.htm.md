# Cardinality and Category Hierarchy

With Marketing Cloud Personalization, you can build category hierarchy using
either the Category ETL or the Sitemap/Event API. Before building your
category hierarchy, choose how you want to configure category cardinality.
Then choose which build approach best suits your business needs.

Before building your category hierarchy, determine which category cardinality
you want to use: one per item or many per item. You choose the cardinality in
the Category catalog object. The Category catalog object plays a key role in
category assignment and tracking statistics.

  * **[Build Category Hierarchy Using the Category ETL](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_catalog_object_category_etl_hierarchy.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Using the Category ETL to build category hierarchy, along with the Category ID
Path framework, results in a hierarchy with a many-per-item category
cardinality.

  * **[Build Category Hierarchy Using the Sitemap/Event API](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_catalog_object_sitemap_event_api_hierarchy.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Using the Sitemap/Event API to build category hierarchy with a many-per-item
category cardinality results in a pipe-delimited category structure that is
separate from the idPath framework used by the category ETL.
