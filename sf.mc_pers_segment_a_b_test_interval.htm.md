# A/B Test Intervals

Learn how A/B test segments can split campaign traffic into intervals, such as
halves, thirds, and quarters.

The upper limit for a segment rule isn’t inclusive. If you create a segment to
include users between 0% and 5%, the segment includes users with values of 0%,
1%, 2%, 3%, and 4%. The next segment of users, 5% to 10%, includes users with
values of 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, and 9%. Each segment has 5% of the users.

These tables list common A/B test intervals.
