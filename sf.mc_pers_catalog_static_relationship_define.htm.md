# Define Static Relationships

Define static relationships to associate products with one another in your
catalog. You can use static relationships as ingredients in Einstein Recipes
to help determine which additional related products to recommend to your
customers.

### Required User Permissions

Permissions Needed  
---  
To define a static relationship: | A role with Catalog Create/Edit permissions  
  
Typically, you define static relationships according to how the products
relate to each other. For example, you can create an "Accessories" static
relationship, and use it to associate certain shoes with a particular dress.
You can also use that "Accessories" static relationship to associate a
keyboard, mouse, and several monitors with a particular laptop. And a “Parts”
static relationship can associate ball bearings with a washing machine, or a
roll of tape with a tape dispenser.

  1. From the main navigation, select **Settings** | **Catalog and Profile Objects**.
  2. In the Static Relationship Names section, enter the **Name** and click **Add Relationship Name**.
  3. Add any additional static relationships.
