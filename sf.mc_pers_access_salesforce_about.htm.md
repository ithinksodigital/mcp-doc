# Personalization Access for Salesforce Customer Support

Learn about granting access to Salesforce employees.

## Why Give Access to Salesforce Employees?

To complete a configuration, respond to support requests, or provide strategic
guidance, Salesforce Customer Support sometimes requests access to your site.
Salesforce employees who request access include support engineers, success
managers, technical architects, and solution architects.

## Duration of Access

When you authorize the support team to log in to your site to assist with
support issues, you can select the duration of access. After the selected
duration is over, you must grant access again.

## Authorizing Individual Salesforce Employees

You can also authorize individual Salesforce employees to access your site to
assist with support, configuration, and strategy.
