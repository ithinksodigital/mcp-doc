# Mobile Campaigns

With Personalization mobile campaigns, you can build and deploy personalized
experiences for your Android and iOS mobile apps using native app code,
including Java, Objective-C, and Swift. Before you can create a mobile
campaign, you must complete the Personalization Mobile SDK implementation.

  * **[About Mobile Campaigns](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_mobile_campaign_about.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
There are three types of mobile campaigns you can create with Marketing Cloud
Personalization: In-App Message, Push, and Data campaigns.

  * **[Create a Mobile In-App Message Campaign](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_mobile_campaign_in_app_message.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
You can use a Mobile In-App Message campaign to build and deploy messages
within mobile apps. Mobile In-App Message campaigns are similar to the infobar
messages you can add to your website. You build, manage, and deploy Mobile In-
App Message campaigns from within Personalization so you get the same real-
time data and personalization you rely on with your other campaigns. You don't
need an engineer's help or App Store approval to deploy new or changed
messages.

  * **[Create a Mobile Data Campaign](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_mobile_campaign_data.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Create Mobile Data campaigns so your iOS and Android apps can process
Personalization campaign data. Personalization triggers campaigns and delivers
the data to your app.

  * **[Create a Mobile Push Campaign](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_mobile_campaign_push.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
Create a Mobile Push campaign to send push notifications to your iOS and
Android app users. For Android users, the campaigns support Firebase Cloud
Messaging (FCM) and require an app integration with the Personalization
Android SDK 1.3 and later. For iOS users, the campaigns support Apple Push
Notification service (APNs) and Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), and require an
app integration with Personalization iOS SDK 1.3 and later.

  * **[Dynamic Message Content](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_mobile_campaign_dynamic_message_content.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
You can use dynamic message content in your mobile campaigns to display the
value of variables like mobile app user name, location, and email dynamically.

  * **[Use Mobile Campaign Rules](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_mobile_campaign_rules.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
A critical part of a good personalization strategy is giving mobile app users
information related to what theyâ€™re doing or feeling in the moment. Use
campaign, experience, and message rules to deliver your message to the right
person at the best time for them.

  * **[Schedule a Mobile Campaign](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_mobile_campaign_schedule.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
You can use the Set Schedule option to define when your Mobile In-App Message
or Mobile Data campaign shows to qualified mobile app users. You can configure
start and end points. You can also display your campaign only during specific
hours for a time period or for all time.
