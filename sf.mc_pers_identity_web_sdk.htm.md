To create unified customer profiles for each of your customers, use
Personalizationâ€™s identity system to configure the identifiers in the
Marketing Cloud Personalization module of the Salesforce Interactions SDK. To
merge user profiles from various sources, you designate an identity type to
use when matching users between channels. You can use multiple identifiers in
a web event.
