# Financial Services - Online to Offline - Sales Cloud and Service Cloud
Integration

Check out these example personalization use cases for Sales Cloud and Service
Cloud integration.

When it comes to personalizing your prospect and customers experience to
increase the conversion rate at each step along the path, consider the
customer lifecycle. There are six key stages in our example of the customer
lifecycle: Research, Discover, Validate, Onboard, Inform, and Expand.

By building on visitor affinities with real-time interactions with your
website, Marketing Cloud Personalization determines the next piece of content
or product they’re most likely to respond to. Making this data available to
offline systems like Sales Cloud or Service Cloud enables salespeople and
service agents to make in-the-moment, relevant recommendations to prospects or
customers.
