# Catalog Localization

The Personalization user interface is available only in English. However, you
can localize parts of the Marketing Cloud Personalization platform.
Localization isn’t supported for the Personalization Platform UI, Mobile SDK,
or Open Time Email.

Personalization supports catalog item localization for individual datasets.
You can create and store localized data for specific fields based on the
language and country codes that you select for the dataset. For catalog items
containing localized data, you can deliver locale-specific personalization
experiences in the language that matches the customer’s locale.

  * **[Ingesting Locale-Specific Product and Catalog Data](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_catalog_locale_product_catalog_data_ingesting.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
You can load localized versions of items into Personalization using several
methods. Personalization supports loading localized iterations using the
Product Localization ETL Data Feed and Catalog Localization ETL Data Feed. You
can also capture the data using the Marketing Cloud Personalization Event API.

  * **[Providing Locale-Specific Personalized Experiences](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_catalog_locale_specific_pers_experiences.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
You can deliver locale-specific personalized experiences using webSDK,
triggered email through Marketing Cloud Engagement, or headless APIs.

  * **[Manage Catalog Localization](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_catalog_localization_manage.htm&language=en_US&type=5)**  
You can localize catalog settings, including the language and currency that
your site uses, and the catalog metadata. You can define a primary locale and
primary currency for each dataset. The primary locale is the dataset’s default
locale.
