# Mobile Campaign-Wide Rules

For all types of mobile campaigns, campaign-wide rules control visibility at
the campaign level based on things such as segments, visit count, visit
duration, user actions, and date and time. Set rules at the campaign level
when you want to holistically control how a campaign displays for qualified
mobile app users.

## Target Users

Target Users rules control who sees a campaign based on any of the following
options:

Option | Description  
---|---  
Segment | The specific segments a mobile app user does or doesnâ€™t belong to. If you include multiple segments, Personalization handles them using AND logic.  
Visit Count | The number of visits is at least, at most, or between a specified number of visits.  
|  
  
## Visit Behavior

Visit Behavior rules consider specifics about the duration of time users spend
in your mobile app and the number of pages they view during the visit.

Option | Description  
---|---  
Current Visit Duration | The length of the duration is more than, less than, or between a specified number of seconds or minutes.  
Page Count | The number of pages the mobile app user views during the visit is more than, less than, or between a specified number of pages.  
  
## Target Pages

Target Pages rules work in Mobile In-App Message and Mobile Push campaigns so
you can choose which action triggers a campaign.

Option | Description  
---|---  
With Action | Shows the campaign after the mobile app user completes a specific action. If you include multiple actions, Personalization handles them using OR logic.  
With Item Action | Shows the campaign after article or item views, purchases, and other user behaviors. If you include multiple item actions, Personalization handles them using OR logic.
