Signals are Guardian’s way of alerting you when a metric falls outside of a
predicted range for the seasonal daily and weekly activity for your site and
dataset. Using signals, Guardian can provide either positive or negative
indications of how metrics are impacting your digital property.

Example

Sometimes, multiple signals that happen concurrently can be related, like a
decrease in orders that creates a reduction in revenue. Other times, the
signals are independent of each other. You can view signals that happen at the
same time so you can understand how events are impacting your digital
property. In the example image, the signals appear to be directly related:
Clickthroughs are down at the same time that Dismissals are up, which appears
to have negatively affected Revenue.
