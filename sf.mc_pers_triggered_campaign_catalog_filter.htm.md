# Catalog Filters

A catalog filter is based on the catalog attributes and dimensions that you’ve
assigned to the item type.

You can add a catalog filter when creating certain triggered campaign types.

A trigger item must meet all the selected catalog filters before the trigger
activates. The filters and values that you can enter are based on your catalog
objects.

Catalog Filter | Description  
---|---  
Average Rating | The average customer rating for the item is or isn’t at least, between, or at most the rating that you enter.  
Price | The item price is or isn’t at least, between, or at most the price that you enter.  
Custom Field | The custom attribute’s value is or isn’t the value that you enter. Depending on your catalog setup, you can include other catalog objects as filters. For more information, see [Catalog Objects](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_pers_catalog_object.htm&language=en_US&type=5 "Catalog objects and their relationships define the structure of your catalog. Personalization uses catalog objects to interpret and understand customer engagement and affinities. Examples of catalog objects include products, articles, blog posts, categories, brands, styles, and features. Personalization includes several built-in catalog objects, and you can create custom ones to meet your specific needs.").

For example, send a promotion to a shopper who spent time viewing a product but didn’t purchase. You can recommend unread articles or products to a visitor who has spent more than 5 minutes reading about a topic. You can remind new users to complete onboarding steps, or alert sales reps when target prospects spend a certain amount of time on your site. When creating a triggered campaign, you can define when to trigger the campaign, which users to target, and which experiences to deliver.")
