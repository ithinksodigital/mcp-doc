# Marketing Cloud Personalization Mobile Integrations

Marketing Cloud Personalization [web
templates](/docs/marketing/personalization/guide/personalization-template-
system.html) are based on responsive HTML and can support web campaigns that
are displayed on mobile devices. However, these "standard" web templates
cannot leverage all of the features and capabilities available to native
mobile apps. For companies and developers who want Personalization to have
access to native mobile app features and capabilities, Personalization
provides an Apple iOS SDK and Android SDK for mobile app integration.

Personalization provides software development kits (SDKs) that developers can
use to integrate Personalization with native iOS and native Android mobile
applications. The Personalization mobile SDKs gather information about the
user, device, and in-app behavior and send it to Personalization to build
profiles, generate statistics, and feed machine learning. The SDKs also handle
event responses containing personalization

for qualified mobile application users.

For complete instructions, SDK specifications, and requirements for mobile app
developers, refer to the following documentation sites.
